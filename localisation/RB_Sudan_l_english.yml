 POLITICS_Stewart_Symes_DESC:0 "Stewart Symes is the leader of what is supposed to be a condominium. The Kingdom of Egypt and the United Kingdom working in tandem to govern Sudan, a concept made as a compromise over who truly owns Sudan. But as the years went by, more and more handles over Sudan was taken from the hands of the Muhammad Ali dynasty, and Sudan became a condominium only in name. The British control the colony, and the King of Egypt mostly controls his own palace, and nothing else.\n\nThe people of the Sudan are fine living their lives in peace, simply farming and grazing cattle, while the British exploit the land for all it’s worth. However, if something touches their lives, they may not be so peaceful in the future. And here Symes sits, hoping anxiously that the Egyptians never get enough power to one day strike back."

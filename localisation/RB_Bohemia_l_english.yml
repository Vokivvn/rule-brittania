 ##Ideas##
 CZE_The_Hrad:0 "The Czech Shadow Government"
 CZE_The_Hrad_desc:0 "After centuries of Habsburg rule, the Czech Revolution has finally allowed the Czechs to gain any sort of autonomy within the empire. But while most of the local populace preferred to set up a democratic regime in Bohemia, most of the political elite feared that newfound province would soon fall into factionalism, and ultimately collapse on itself, giving both the English and the Austrians an excuse to end the Czech experiment. On the other hand, setting up the autocratic regime would barely be any better than the direct rule from Vienna. To cope with potential political problems within the Kingdom while keeping the democratic system alive, the first Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bohemia Tomáš Masaryk has created the Committee of Seven, also known as Sedmička, which included the most important people in the Czech politics, and which goal was to provide expert guidance to the new government. Additionally, several extra-governmental political organizations known as The Hrad have been raised under Mr. Masaryk's unofficial command, such as the Czech Hussite Church or the Legiobanka, which goals were to grant new Prime Minister powers beyond those declared in the constitution. While this system clearly is not democratic, it has kept a czech on the parliamentary system and provided the realm with a significant degree of stability."
 CZE_German_Bohemians:0 "The German Bohemians"
 CZE_German_Bohemians_desc:0 "The Czechs are not the only people living within the borders of Bohemia. Composing nearby 30% of the population, German Bohemians are the biggest minority in the Kingdom and definitely the most influential one Occupying either highly industrialized Sudetes or various manors and estates spread around the entire nation, this ethnic group holds significant influence both on Prague's and Vienna's decision making."
 CZE_Nominal_Part_Of_The_Habsburg_Realm:0 "A Nominal Part Of The Habsburg Realm"
 CZE_Nominal_Part_Of_The_Habsburg_Realm_desc:0 "The ceasefire made after the Czech Revolt has granted the Crown Of Bohemia a significant degree of autonomy, however, those lands are still in the Austrian Empire, at least nominally. While it's true that the British influence has been slowly pushing back the Austrian one, Vienna's government is still a significant player in Czech politics. Fortunately for us, Rudolf VI's administration has proven to be utterly ineffective at any task, and more importantly, current envoy to the Crown of Bohemia, Julius Deutsch, is more than friendly to the idea of the Czech nation, hoping it will be a model for the rest of Danube. However, the situation could change quickly if any future ruler of the Austrian Empire would prove themselves to be actually competent."
 CZE_The_English_Influence:0 "The English Influence"
 CZE_The_English_Influence_desc:0 "As in any other place in this world, the English held significant sway in Bohemia. Most of the Czech trade is conducted with the British Empire and German realms which are firmly within the English sphere. The British are also significant kingmakers within the Czechia, with London's connections being oftentimes worth their weight in gold. And let us not forget constant meddling with Czech politics and the everlooming possibility of invasion. Looking from the positive side, British strategy within our country at least moves us away from the Austrian sphere, and possibly towards true freedom from Vienna's autocracy."

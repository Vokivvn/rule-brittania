 ### Ideas ###
 SWE_swedish_royal_army:0 "The Swedish Royal Army"
 SWE_swedish_royal_army_desc:0 "The Swedish Royal Army, formerly a bunch of soldiers that helped the "first" king of Sweden in solidifying his royal claim, is a special branch in the Svenska Armén, which is specialized in counter-insurgency operations, partisan hunting and missions that require agility and quickness in general. While being seen by many as "an undemocratic institution" and "a tool of oppresion", it does it's job in defending the Empire from enemies within just fine."
 SWE_empire_realized:0 "Stormaktstiden"
 SWE_empire_realized_desc:0 "Stormaktstiden, also known as "the Era of Great Power" in English, is a term for describing the prosperous state of Sweden which began the in 19th century and continues to this day. With the fall of all of Sweden's enemies and the "installment" of the House of Baden on the Swedish throne, an era of unbelievable prosperity followed the Empire. With some help from the Anglo, the House of Baden has consolidated the power, and with no enemies at the borders, cultural and scientific progress in Sweden has exploded. We have one of the best positions in the entirety of Europe, and we are proud of it, but only God knows how quickly the tide can turn."
 SWE_pro_anglo_stance:0 "A Toast For The Anglo"
 SWE_pro_anglo_stance_desc:0 "Despite all the "disputes" and "controversies" we had in the past, a Swede and an Anglo have become one of the best friends in Europe. With England watching the West and the North, Sweden watches the East and the South, defending Europe from the savages of Russia and barbarians of Germany. Our relations grew from unwitting union to true friendship, and An Anglo wouldn't betray the Swede just like the Swede wouldn't betray an Anglo, right? Right?"
 SWE_finnish_unrest:0 "The Ones Who Shall Dwell In The Snow"
 SWE_finnish_unrest_desc:0 "The Era of Nationalism didn't bring only the benefits for our Empire. With the rise of unification movements in Germany, our "friends" in the East jumped on the wagon too, demanding utter nonsense like "full autonomy" and "language rights". Of course we don't subject to such absurd claims, but their stupidity slowly becomes more and more dangerous each day, with them starting to grab guns and attack our bases. The most worrying issue is that there are Finn symphatizers in our military as well, and should a conflict break out, defects and mutinies are to be expected."

 charismatic_despot:0 "Charismatic Despot"
 POLITICS_BERTHOLD_I_DESC:0 "Berthold I of Sweden is certainly isn't a reluctant kind of king. Despite being "only" 30, he has already managed to earn a title for him. The title may vary depending on political stance of the person, from "The Chief Doctor" and "Revitalizer" to "The Man with the Iron Heart" to "The Butcher Of Suomi" to "Animal" and so on.\n\nYet, not a single person can say that Berthold isn't a far-sighted man. With each strike he makes at the Finnish resistance, "the terrible end to the terror without end" comes closer and closer, be it peacefful total Swedification of Finland or bloody and gruesome rebellion which will end the Finnish nation as one would know it. All the terror he does isn't made just for the sake of terror, though: he would be happy to strike a deal with Finns, but there is one threat which leaves no choice but to continue all the terrible things he does.\n\nThe Russians are coming.\n\nHe grew up looking at newspapers and seeing nothing but Alexander IV's military modernisations that stun the rest of Europe. He went with a state visit to Moskva to find hordes of fanatics that are willing to die for a city they never visisted and never possessed. He knows that there will be a war which will turn the entire European military tradition upside down, and it's most likely that it'll be Alexander's war. He also knows that there is no enemy for Alexander but him, so the Swedish King resolves to desperate measures. He has an industrial base that rivals several countries of Europe at once, a loyal army and English protection, but all of these things may fade away in a blink of an eye.\n\nThe coming Northern War will not only be a conclusion to Alexander IV's regime, but to the Swedish crown as well, so there is no choice, there is no way, but there is no turning back either."

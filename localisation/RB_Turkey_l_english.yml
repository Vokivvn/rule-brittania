But his imperial majesty, sultan Ahmed IV rose every day to meet these challenges, perhaps for no reason other than a desire to prove to his people that the empire hadn’t truly died on the battlefields of the Levant eighteen years ago. \n\nEighteen years... had it really been that long since the war ended? The sultan can scarcely believe it himself... eighteen years of peace! Hardly a diamond jubilee... but still, it did call for something..."

 #Turkish Civil War Events
 tcw.1.t:0 "The March on Bursa"
 tcw.1.d:0 "Selim is a simple soldier of the Imperial Guard, a young man who like many within the unit find themselves dismayed by the coming storm. Military service is a family tradition for him, his father was an infantry officer, serving among the feared Hamidiyye divisions of the Red Sultan. He fought for his sultan, against the British that came from the sea and sand of the Hejaz and Levant... and he died for his sultan in the deserts of Syria. \n\n\"He was struck with an artillery shell\" said the officer informing Selim’s mother, \"There are no remains of him found, his grave is in Al-Sham.\". \n\n\"No remains found\" Selim heard. A man sacrificed all of his blood and flesh to a sultan, a Red Sultan. A Red Sultan who brought nothing but shame, suffering, oppression, death, and poverty to his country. His father’s sacrifice was gone for nothing, all because of a Red Sultan.\n\nWhen Prince Fuad called on the Imperial Guard, and asked them to draw swords against the new Sultan, many protested. They claimed it treason, they said it would start a second era of Interregnum, they said it would be going against the guards duty to betray the sultan. But Selim know better. \n\nSelim stood for the Prince, he reminded the Guard of Selim II, and how he had to topple his own father from the throne so he may rise, and conquer lands from Adana to Hejaz, Hejaz to Ethiopia. Selim told them that if they want this land of their fathers, and their fathers, to prosper once more, to strike fear at the infidel hearts once more, they must gather behind not a caged bird, but a hunting falcon.\n\nSelim now marches on, marches on to the city of Bursa, just so no more children may be orphaned by a second Red Sultan."
 tcw.1.a:0 "If Orhan wants a war, we will give him one!"
 tcw.2.t:0 "The March on Izmir"
 tcw.2.d:0 "It was a quiet day in Bursa, like so many had been since Sultan Orhan the Second’s ascension to the throne. No birds were singing, no vendors were yelling, it was as if nature itself could sense what was going on. The eerie silence of the city was only disturbed by the sound of military boots, trampling the cobblestone streets. A squad of paramilitary soldiers with hands at their swords and rifles swinging on their back, were approaching the Beylik Palace, where the young sultan resides.\n\nThe sultan was even more quiet than the city he rules over, sitting on a throne covered in a curtain of shadows, simply listening to the conversation his mentor and the squad officier were having. \"Even the suggestion of that is ridiculous! The days of kinslaying among the dynasty is far gone!\" said the officer, his mustache trembling in shock. \n\n\"Do you know why his Majesty has chosen this old, crumbling palace as his seat of power?\" said Nihal Bey. The officer stood in silence. \"This palace was the first ever seat of the earliest sultans, the gate you have entered is the first ever Sublime Porte! It was built by Orhan the First, who took his father’s small fiefdom, and forged an empire out of it.\" Nihal Bey’s arms spread around under the dome of the throne room. \"His Majesty, Orhan the Second, is here to forge a new era for the Turkish nation, in a great flame that’ll consume all who represent the stagnant authority of old. If Prince Fuad decided to stand against this inevitability, he may as well be the first to be cast into the fire.\", said the sultan’s mentor, grinning like a hungry wolf who just found his prey. \n\nIt was no longer silent in Bursa, the silence of this city had been sacrificed... so that another city, Izmir, could be made silent forever."
 tcw.2.a:0 "Kill them all!"

 #Leader Descs
 POLITICS_AHMED_IV_DESC:0 "Sultan Ahmed IV, born Ahmed Nihad, was never supposed to be Sultan. The Grandson of Sultan Murad V, he would spend much of his early life in house arrest, courtesy of his Great Uncle, Sultan Abdul Hamid "the Red Sultan" II.\n\nHis fortunes would change following the Anglo-Turkish War, which would see his usurper uncle removed from the throne, and his captivity ended. Put on the Imperial throne by the British to rule the rump Ottoman Protectorate, he would, despite the limitations of his position, attempt to rebuild the country following the war. Ruling dutifully and piously, his greatest accomplishment by far has been rehabilitating the image of the Sultan following the disasters of his Great Uncle’s reign.\n\nUnfortunately for the Sultan, his health has recently taken a turn for the worst. Attempting to keep his influence within the cut throat politics of the protectorate, and keep the British High Commissioner in check, has exhausted the man. Worse still, resentment towards the British among the Ottoman people grows more and more daily, as the hated High Commissioner and his Janissary thugs continue a reign of terror. With dissent building and the sultans health failing, it seems that once again the very foundations of the Sultanate itself will be shaken to their core."

 tur_turkish_intikamcilik_desc:0 "There remains, despite the best efforts of Grahame and his thugs, an indomitable bitterness within the Turkish people towards their current state. Many, many, many Turks look back fondly at their imperial past, and dream of one day kicking the hated anglos out and reclaiming what was and is rightfully theirs. \n\nThis has manifested itself in a continued fondness for nationalist groups such as the PUP, and a general desire for just about anything that would significantly change the status quo."

At the very center of this economic development is the city of Izmir, a shining beacon of British industry, culture, and imperial might within the East."

 tur_the_young_turk_revolution_desc:0 "In retrospect, it seems almost inevitable, that the Turkish people would rise up on mass following nearly two decades of political repression and economic stagnation. While the events of the janissary incident, which lead to the deaths of Grahame and Ahmet Pasha served as the immediate spark, the powderkeg had been growing for long before that. \n\nThe bitter reality is, the protectorate has been thrown into chaos, battles rage in the streets between nationalists and loyalists, the imperial court cowers, and no one knows who will end up ruling the ashes."
 tur_economic_revolution:0 "The Economic Revolution"
 tur_economic_revolution_desc:0 "As the political revolution began, so too did the economic revolution within the protectorate. Industry workers, long denied their rights and privledges by the British colonial authorities, launched mass riots and seizures of factories. Agricultural workers, long neglected and run into poverty by cheap British agricultural imports, formed roving gangs in the countryside, attacking any farmer suspected of being pro-British. \n\nAnd within London itself, the news of the protectorate going up in smoke started a mass scare among investors."

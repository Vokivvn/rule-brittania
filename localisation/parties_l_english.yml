 liberalism_subtype_desc:0 "Liberalism is somewhat of a half-way point between Parliamentarianism and Marxism, espousing socialist values such as stricter labour laws and compensation for workers, but at the same time supporting the currently-existing systems, rather than revolution. Liberalism has evolved over time from ideas that would now be considered Republican into its modern form, but always existing as a left-wing ideology.\n\nLiberalism, unlike Republicanism, is not always, well, Republican. As one of the largest opposition parties in the British Empire and as the leading party in the Californian government, there are plenty of examples of Liberalism without Republicanism. However, many Liberals face stiff opposition in a primarily right-wing world, being denounced as Marxists and Republicans."

 republicanism_subtype_desc:0 "Republicanism is a form of government believing in the complete destruction of the monarchy and replacement with a democratic system where leaders are elected from the people to serve the people. With a primary basis in Ancient Athens and the Roman Republic, the latter being the origin of the term, Republicanism believes that these prior systems must be built upon to create a truly democratic state.\n\nAnother source of inspiration for Republicanism is the parliamentary system used by the British Empire and other nations. Being seen as one of the most modern democratic institutions, most Republicans support a parliamentary system within the government. That is, of course, without a House of Lords and a monarch, with another elected house and the aformentioned elected official serving in their place."

 ##Ideas##

 LEV_Arab_Kingdom_of_Syria:0 "Arab Kingdom of Syria"
 LEV_Arab_Kingdom_of_Syria_desc:0 "Every map in the world shows the nation in the Fertile Crescent stretching from Damascus to Hafar Al-Batin as some form of the Emirate of the Levant, a British protectorate ruled by an Emir. This map is different within the nation that it depicts– Emir Faisal (or as he calls himself, King Faisal) insists that there is no Emirate of the Levant, but rather the Arab Kingdom of Syria. He insists that his nation is free of British and even has ownership over Palestine.\n\nHowever, the so-called King is only allowed to rule because the British delegates in Damascus haven’t ordered the garrison to overthrow him yet– and whenever the British want something from him, he’s always ready to reconcile– not as King, but as Emir."

 LEV_TE_Lawrence:0 "T.E. Lawrence"
 LEV_TE_Lawrence_desc:0 "T.E. Lawrence, Hero of the Anglo-Turkish War, leader of the Arab Revolt, and personal friend to the Emir has been assigned as the personal advisor to Faisal, as well as speaker of the Arab National Council.\n\nDespite being the architect of British hegemony in the Near East, he seems to be almost sympathetic to Arab nationalism. He’s been offered better jobs by the crown with higher salaries in better locations, but Lawrence has decided that he would be happier working with his friend."

 LEV_Mount_Lebanon_Autonomy:0 "Mount Lebanon Autonomy"
 LEV_Mount_Lebanon_Autonomy_desc:0 "The historical region of Mount Lebanon is a melting pot of cultures and faiths, harboring Sunnis, Shiites, Druze, Alawites, Catholics, Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, and the most important of all– Maronites. It was an autonomous zone in the Ottoman Empire when the British conquered the region, and Britain demands that it remains an autonomous region to protect the Maronite population. Despite the autonomy lowering unrest in the region, profits from the important cities of Tripoli, Tyre, and most importantly Beirut go to institutions within the autonomy rather than to the Emirate itself."

 ##Desc##

 POLITICS_FAISAL_I_DESC:0 "All hail Faisal I bin Hussein bin Ali al-Hashemi, the ruler of Greater Syria and liberator of the Arabs from the dastardly Turks. Faisal is a member of the Hashemites, a prestigious dynasty that historically ruled over Mecca. His father, Sharif Hussein, spent nearly 20 years as the Sharif and Emir of Mecca and even briefly laid claim to the title of Caliph. Faisal is a war hero of the sorts, leading a rebellion against the Turks with T. E. Lawrence during the Anglo-Turkish War. His Sharifian Army conquered Jeddah, marched into Aqaba, and besieged Damascus to establish Faisal’s Arab Kingdom of Syria– or as its known to everyone else in the world, the Emirate of the Levant.\n\nFaisal dreams of a pan-Arab state, where all Arabs are unified under one banner. But his dream comes in conflict with the British, who wish to see the Arab people even more disunited than ever."

 world.3.t:0 "Nuclear Detonation Reported In Siberia"
 world.3.desc:0 "Defying all possible predictions and assumptions, the Russian ultranationalist organisation "Grey Wolves" has managed to detonate a nuclear bomb in testing ground near Akmolinsk. The bomb's projected power is about 10 kilotons of TNT, which is considered a "medium" version of a bomb of this type. The organisation has taken several photographs of the explosion and shared it with journalists, unclassifying their work. With this new acquisition and demonstration of the ability to make the world's most destructive weaponry by the Grey Wolves, the world is reaching the new era of war and diplomatic relations, and the future is worrying."

 world.4.t:0 "Grey Wolves Warn The British Empire"
 world.4.desc:0 "In a rather predictable way, the Siberian ultranationalists, now controlling all of Russia, issued a formal warning against all countires that "threaten Russian dominance in their region" with implying the British forces in regions surrounding Russia. In a recent conference of the organisation, it was decided to make the warning public and "warn all possible enemies of Russia" that Russia will retaliate quickly against all "possible threats", also leaving an omnious note that they have "means of preserving sovereignty they can't even fathom", hinting at possible biological, chemical or nuclear weapon research or arsenal. With such announcements, the true intentions of Grey Wolves cannot be any more clear."

 #LEADER DESCRIPTIONS
 POLITICS_AUGUST_WILHELM_I_DESC:0 "The fourth son of the once-venerated Wihelm II, August Wilhelm rules as a nascent British puppet. He had always considered himself a legitimate monarch, but his lack of interest in the infamous institution of the Prussian military has made him somewhat of an outlier, along with his propensity for aiding the British interest groups in the nation. Not only is he an unpopular man, but estranged from his father as well. On top of it all, his unusual pick as the British-installed monarch led to tension in what remained of the von Hohenzollern dynasty, as his older brothers felt snubbed. Perhaps he wishes he could be more than what he is, however, it is simply too risky for his liking.\n\nChoosing to pursue the ambitions of the crown even after being manipulated by the British, August Wilhelm has ruled in a near-identical manner to his British overlords, with similar political systems and ideals. He has loosened his grip on the corporations, formed a parliamentary coalition which rules in his name, and has integrated the Prussian economy into the broader global system. Without the expensive military budget dragging on the national budget, the Prussian financial system is able to effectively operate without any worry of increased defense spending. August Wilhelm’s pride in his political science doctorate has led to his expansion of the franchise to most male Prussians, however, both his degree and the elections in which he boasts of are quite dubious in nature, and only serve as an argument to overthrow the king in revolutionary circles.\n\nMany wish in his realm that he would stand up for them, while many others simply detest him. Some laud his great political achievements and ability to preserve what remains of Prussia, while others detest his reactionary and corrupt policies which have ruined their beloved country. A controversial man, in all circles of the world, he is also one of the most famous men in world history, with no modern leader having followed his footsteps. The son of a madman, the ruler of a ruined state, and the leader of an unhappy people, clearly, August Wilhelm has many more hardships yet to endure in his tumultuous life."
 
 ##Ideas##
 #PRU_Broken_Nation:0 "A Broken Nation"
 #PRU_Broken_Nation_desc:0 "The year 1889 brings a tear to most Prussians’ eyes. The year that the esteemed Prussian military imploded in the face of its greatest challenge; the year that the old Kaiser was forced to live in his Sigmaringen Castle for seemingly, forever. A feeling of national sorrow had gripped the once-proud nation, the feeling that the war could have been won if it were not for the geriatric generals and their ego, or perhaps more tellingly, the Junkers and their desire to grow wealthier with the aid of the British.\n\nThe black eagle that had once proudly soared above Prussian roofs now laid vanquished; the standard that the noble grenadiers and brave soldiers had fought under now fluttered in British war museums. Breslau, Danzig, Oldenburg, Kattowitz: all are now underneath a foreign boot.Many Prussians hope that the British will be smitten by a wrathful vengeance, someday, maybe the old Barbarossa myth will come true.\n\n\n“The good Kaiser Friedrich will awaken in our country’s hour of need, and save us all.”, as the tale goes."
 #PRU_Foreign_Meddling:0 "Foreign Meddling"
 #PRU_Foreign_Meddling_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Prussia is, according to all official maps and government records, an independent nation and the pre-eminent power in Northern Germany. Our military is officially as mighty as ever, our economy as sturdy as ever, and our government run by the ideas and notions of our beloved king. Like the cheapest golden foil, these lies peel away when put under even the smallest scrutiny. The policies of our government change with the value of the London stock market, our King’s principals with a whisper from the British high commissioner. The Prussian Junkers, long the spitting image of honor and military might, have become a fat and rowdy bunch, fed like a baby from the tit of British bribes and patronage.\n\nIt has become increasingly clear, for radicals on both the right and the left, that only by the bayonet of revolution can we save our beloved Fatherland."
 #PRU_Stagnant_Industrialisation:0 "Stagnant Industrialization"
 #PRU_Stagnant_Industrialisation_desc:0 "The Prussian industrial economy, at one point believed to be the next workshop of the world, has long stagnated. Competition from British firms combined with the inability to raise domestic tariffs has devastated our ability to compete and forced the lowering of wages across the board. This has in turn resulted in union unrest and near constant strikes, which has in turn led to dropping foreign and domestic investment causing our industry to become even less competitive. It is a truly vicious cycle, and another issue that no one within the King’s government seems to have any answer for."
 #PRU_Fierce_Opposition_Militias:0 "Fiercely-Opposing Militias"
 #PRU_Fierce_Opposition_Militias_desc:0 "The Sozialdemokratische Partei Preußen, or more commonly referred to as the SPP, is a powerful but yet splintered opposition to the British-installed monarchy. With its deadly divide, the SPP is often unable to even congregate in the same party meetings without a bout. Revolutionary versus reformist, social democrat versus communist, Prussian worker versus Prussian worker, and above all, German versus German.\n\nWith this fierce competition, there is doubt if the SPP will ever wrestle control of the state away from the hands of British capitalists into the German workers’, or at the very least, as a united front."

 pru.1.t:0 "The Iron Kingdom"
 pru.1.desc:0 "From duchy to margraviate to kingdom to this. Prussia's history is a shocking story of how quickly something can decline and fall from a good position. The Grand Elector and his son Frederick expanded Prussia's territories greatly, through adept dynastic maneuverings and timely military conquest, but the rise and expansion were not destined to last forever.\n\nBritain's diplomatic switch in the 19th century meant Britain giving up its relations to Prussia, in favor for Austria, who soon began rattling their sabres, to take back Silesia, their lost lands from the great war in the late 18th century"

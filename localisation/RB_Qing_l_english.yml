##Idea Names##
CHI_nominally_dependent:0 "Nominally Dependent"
CHI_nominally_dependent_desc:0 "Our special relationship with the British Empire has left us dependent on them both economically and politically. Should something happen to disrupt this relationship, the results could be either opportune or disasterious."
CHI_shattered_empire:0 "Shattered Empire"
CHI_shattered_empire_desc:0 "Following decades of Unequal Treaties signed between our government and the British Empire, the Viceroyalties of the Great Ching enjoy an incredible amount of autonomy. Though de-jure territory of the Emperor, it is not uncommon for Viceroys and their administrations to engage in deals with foreign powers and form political alliances amongst eachother."
CHI_forbidden_city:0 "Forbidden City Politics"
CHI_forbidden_city_desc:0 "The court of the Hsuantung Emperor is no doubt a noble one, but posesses limited authority over the nation it claims to administer. In reality, the Emperor's government sits cooped up in the Forbidden City, exerting so little influence that the government can only be said to really control up to the outskirts of Peking. This situation keeps politics local and hopelessly lost when it comes to matters beyond the capital."
CHI_legacy_of_treaties:0 "Legacy of Unequal Treaties"
CHI_legacy_of_treaties_desc:0 "When the British came to the Middle Kingdom offering trade, they brought nothing to interest the Great Ching. Now, over a century later, the tides have turned: English flags fly over Chinese ports, Manchu administrators wear breasted suits, and schoolchildren showcase to their parents the fluency of their English. China has been forced to accept her loss in the most degrading way possible as the Chinese identity erodes away."
CHI_mandate_of_heaven:0 "The Mandate of Heaven"
CHI_mandate_of_heaven_desc:0 "Aisin-Gioro Pu-yi, he who rules China as the Hsuantung Emperor, rules his fief with the blessing of divinity. So long as he retains this halmark of legitimacy, the Boy Emperor will rule well and with the faith of his peers. Should disaster strike the Great Ching, however, the Gods will have shown their distaste for the Emperor and shall revoke their Mandate, throwing the Middle Kingdom into chaos."

 #descs
 CHI_RULEBRITANNIA_DESC:0 "Once, long ago, the Son of Heaven ruled from the forested vallies of Kwantung across the Han plans into the steep peaks of the Himmalayas all by his own will. But now, following over a century of humiliation, the Emperor's will extends barely beyond his kitchenstaff, much less the viceroys and governors who administer the Great Ching. Concessions to autonomy and English economic interests have left the Empire a wracked, weak structure in dire need of reform. Can the Emperor reassert his will upon his patromony, or will stronger men bring about national rebirth from the inside?"

 ##LEADER DESCS##
 POLITICS_ROBERT_GARRAN_DESC:0 "Born in 1867, into a politically active family in Sydney, New Wales, Garran practiced law and was called to the bar in 1891. Following the ideals of his father, he became heavily involved in the Federation Movement and met with several prominent figures leading the campaign. He served as secretary of the drafting committee during the 1932 Constitution, and played a key role in the establishment of a united Australian legal system.\n\nHis participation in the early Australian government has painted him as a founding father, and he has nominal approval amongst both sides of the civilian population. However, Garran still has many issues to tackle, such as the economic inequality generated by the century of squattocracy, and the touchy issue of the “White Australia Policy”. Most important of all, as news of political unrest spreads from Swan River Colony, Garran has to come to the realization that his job of federalizing the continent may not be complete after all..."

 ##IDEAS##
 AST_White_Australia_Policy:0 "White Australia Policy"
 AST_White_Australia_Policy_desc:0 "While the Gold Rush brought wealth and development to Australia, it also brought thousands of immigrant miners. Competition on the gold fields lead to both labor unions and colonial governments enacting anti-immigrant and anti-aboriginal stances collectively known as the 'White Australia Movement'. The movement has influenced Australian law, and has been a defining policy of the conservative politicians in Australia."
 AST_Spirit_Of_Federation:0 "Spirit of Federation"
 AST_Spirit_Of_Federation_desc:0 "The Commonwealth of Australia was founded in 1934, as a union of the formerly separate British colonies on the continent. Modeled after the American and Californian theories of democracy and unity, the colonies,all except for Swan River, banded together under a single flag, with a single capital, and a single prime minister.\n\nWhile there are still many issues that the Commonwealth of Australia has to face, the Federation has lead to a new national unity for its citizens: not a British one, but a truly Australian one."
 AST_End_Of_Gold_Rush:0 "End of the Gold Rush"
 AST_End_Of_Gold_Rush_desc:0 "The valuable mineral deposits in our southern regions have begun to dry up. In the historic mining region of Port Phillip, all that remains is large companies and a few wishful miners that arrived a little too late. Meanwhile, in the newly acquired state of Auralia, the vast majority of gold there has also been extracted, gambled, and lost.\n\nThis does not worry the local governments in these regions, as they have already gained much from the mining endeavors. New hotels, shops, and thousands of immigrants has revitalized the development of South Australia. Now all that’s left for the local governments to do is siphon the funds from the few remaining miners, and call it a day."
 AST_Remnants_Of_The_Squattocracy:0 "Remnants of the Squattocracy"
 AST_Remnants_Of_The_Squattocracy_desc:0 "Since the conception of Australia as a colony, there has always been a form of social divide. Whether it be warden and prisoner, settler and native, or more recently, landowner and land worker, an uncomfortable gap between the status of Australian peoples has persisted.\n\nFor nearly a century, landowners controlled large plots of land in the untamed pasture, with smaller farmers being squeezed out or forced to work in another squatter’s estate. The largest of these squatters had a large influence in their local government and economy. This system has been partially eroded by the new federation government, however it’s undeniable that large remnants of this 'squattocracy' is still in effect."

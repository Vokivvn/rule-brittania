 NET_UK_Membership_desc:0 "While many lands have fallen under the British Crown via personal union, none have been more influential than the Dutch. Being the first of several Anglo-European territorial connections, the status of the Netherlands was elevated to a fully fledged member of the now United Kingdom of Great Britain, Ireland, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe Second Act of Union would soon follow, as the Dutch government was reorganized, complete with a devolved National Assembly, bureaucratic organisation of colonial territory between Dutch and British holdings, and a local nobility, stylised as Prince of the Netherlands and hailing from the House of Oudenburcht, formerly the German House of Oldenburg."
 NET_Power_Delegated_to_Assembly:0 "Power Delegated to the Assembly"
 NET_Power_Delegated_to_Assembly_desc:0 "Under the Second Act of Union, the Dutch Parliament was reorganized into the Dutch National Assembly, a system delegated statutory powers that were nearly identical to Westminster in London.\n\nThe main seat of power originated from the Prince of the Netherlands, a role that, in recent decades, has became much less important, and therefore much less influential. From the perspective of many British politicians, this leaves the Dutch having an uncomfortable level of devolution from the crown."
 
 ##Leader Desc##
 POLITICS_NIKOLAUS_VAN_OLDENBURG_DESC:0 "Nikolaus van Oudenburcht, Prince of the Netherlands, is one of the most well-known British Lords, with his conservative, traditionalist, and at times even nationalistic views. Nikolaus has long stated his desire to "go back to the old ways" of the monarchy - which many suspect means absolute rule to himself, as Prince of the Netherlands.\n\nWith his distrust of the British for a supposed encroachment upon his power, alongside his absolutist traditionalism, he has found a friend in Fürst Wilhelm, himself a ravingly nationalistic German noble. However, unlike the Fürst, Nikolaus does not find much interest in the Dutch throne. Rather, he has much bigger plans, that stretch beyond the Netherlands and westwards to London."

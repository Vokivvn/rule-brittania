 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ILYA_STARINOV_DESC:0 "GRANDFATHER OF SPETSNAZ"
 POLITICS_AUGUSTUS_AGAR_DESC:0 "While Augustus Willington Shelton Agar is no true Englishman, being born to an Irish father, he without any doubt holds every virtue natural to the finest gentlemen. Honourable, courageous, and most of all, totally devoted to the King and Country. His career in the Navy was as majestic as his personal conduct, with Agar leading his ships to victory against the enemies of the Crown time and time again.\n\nIt's no wonder that Commodore Agar has found himself in London's good graces, and that he was honoured with a very important position as governor of the British Far Eastern Territories. Some don't consider that position that prestigious, announcing obviously false statements about those Territories, like that there's nothing to be found there except ice and the insurgent groups of Northern Siberia, along with the corruption and decadence of Eastport. There's obviously a grain of truth in every statement - the Far East doesn't enjoy such status nor opportunity as the Siberian Industrial Zone, and some local people are less than splendid in their behaviour toward the British Administration - but most of these statements are obviously mere slander. After all, no land can be in a state of anarchy if it's governed by British.\n\nAnd Agar indeed knows better than to listen to some doom-mongers. He already has a plan on how to bring the Far Eastern Territories' reputation back. A plan to change the Far East from forgotten and discredited by everyone back home, to a model colony of the British Empire, one of which every Englishman, Russian or any other people of the British domain would be envious."

 ### Ideas ###
 BFE_port_of_eastport:0 "The Port Of Eastport"
 BFE_port_of_eastport_desc:0 "The grand city of Eastport, once known as Vladivostok, has great importance to the Empire - it is home to one of, if not the largest British fleet in the East, and the immense infrastructure that comes with that has led to the city's vital strategic interest to the Crown. The dockyards are teeming with life, all working to support the British naval forces. Stray too far from the docks, and the influence of the British rapidly disappears, however, something of little concern to the navy, but much more important to those in charge of governing the colony."
 BFE_the_wild_frontier:0 "The Wild Frontier"
 BFE_the_wild_frontier_desc:0 "Eastport may be a bustling city but the majority of our territory is too vast and disconnected from the capital to effectively govern or patrol. Numerous settlements are founded by people looking to escape their pasts. Mercenaries of many nations and creeds look for fortune and glory in the frontier. They, and the local Baikal Cossack host are used in the pacification of this wild land. Time will tell if it was a mistake to let them have free reign."
 BFE_a_wretched_hive_of_scum_and_villainy:0 "A Wretched Hive Of Scum And Villainy"
 BFE_a_wretched_hive_of_scum_and_villainy_desc:0 "Eastport is a major hub of trade within East Asia. Tons of cargo are transferred through it, coming from and to America, Asia, and sometimes even more away locations. However money is always closely followed by wickedness, and Eastport's walls have embraced it fully. Local or foreign mercenaries waiting for another job, dealers offering an always changing assortment of various substances for sale, smugglers trying to escape Royal Navy's grasp, gangs and mafias fighting for dominance, or just common crooks looking to make a quick buck - you can find every type of scoundrel here. If one is a proper citizen, this isn't a city they're looking for. If one is not, this is their long lost home."
 BFE_bandit_problem:0 "Bandit Problem"
 BFE_bandit_problem_desc:0 "Across the frozen tundras of Siberia, hordes of bandits, rebels, criminals, revolutionaries, communist partisans, exiles, unruly Cossacks, and just about any other possibly disreputable person can be found, free to do whatever they want, far from the reach of the colonial authorities in Eastport. While there are mercenaries supposedly imposing British rule on the wastes, they are at best ineffective and at worst disloyal, leading to a lack of order outside the cities and settlements."
 BFE_backwater_industry:0 "Backwater Industry"
 BFE_backwater_industry_desc:0 "British Far East Territories industrial sector can be described at best as developing, at worst as virtually non-existing. This lack of any industrial development is caused by a multitude of reasons, including but not restricted to massive corruption within Eastport, lack of any skilled personnel, and the London government seemingly ignoring this spot in favour of other, less depressing corners of the Earth. Successful industrialization of this colony will demand an incredible effort, otherwise it will eventually fail."

 BFE.1.t:0 "The Pearl Of The East"
 BFE.1.desc:0 "The Far East Territories, pride of British East Asia. Custodian of the immeasurable natural resources of Siberia. Or so it seems. The "nation" that Governor Augustus Agar rules over, if it can even be called that, is a den of corruption, crime, and chaos endlessly waiting to collapse.\n\nOutside the capital city, bandits, exiled revolutionaries, and other unsavory types rule the wilderness, staking out huge kingdoms within our borders. While ideally, we could simply dispatch the forces of our army to put an end to that menace, our forces are stretched thin as it is. With the absence of a professional army, we have resorted to mercenaries, as well as the local Cossacks. This suits us for now, but if we give these mercenaries too much free reign, we may find our government on even thinner ice than it already is.\n\nAnd that's not to say that Eastport is pacified, either. Gangs of criminals run much of the day-to-day life on the streets, and their ill-gotten income is enough that they can afford to bribe just about any colonial officials who get a little too nosy. Of these gangs, one stands above the others - the Syndicate. Their influence in Eastport is almost comparable to our own - a humiliating state for the Governor and the few officials left who have a genuine desire to serve the Empire and not just their own self-interests.\n\nBut Agar has had enough. For too long have criminals controlled the streets of the capital. For too long common thugs have travelled the countryside, laying waste to all in their way. For too long has the will of the King gone unfulfilled. But now, that will end.\n\nAgar may be just one man, but regardless of the problems he is still the most powerful in the Far East. Now that he has set his mind to fixing up the colony, there are only two outcomes - Agar will succeed, or the British may find Siberia to be untamable, even for them."

 POLITICS_JOHN_KEYNES_DESC:0 "Being brilliant during your university years mean nothing if your later work becomes laughing stock. John Maynard Keynes, born 1883 in Cambridge, is a prime example of this story. After completing a bachelor's degree in mathematics, Keynes began work in India as a clerk, feeling unfulfilled, he returned to Cambridge beginning the work on a study of British economical policy in India, being published as Indian Currency and Finance. A few dons in Cambridge were impressed with his high skills statistical analysis and historical interpretation, and offered him a doctorate position.\n\nThis was the place he belonged, among scholars, intelectuals and important thinkers. Having analysed trends and historical events in detail, he had come up with a theory, a general theory of economic development and his suggestions for future economical policy. Sadly, noone else believed him, his doctoral disputas was a failure and his dissertation was rejected.\n\nRunning back to his group of friends, and on the gathering that night, he gambled away too much money. On a wager, he was to get his money back if he got the governorship of Chad, which was known by one of the attendants to recently be vacant.\n\nNow, Keynes was placed in Chad, having one goal in mind, to prove his theories and get the professorate in Cambridge that he had dreamed of all his life."

 CHA_laboratory:0 "Real Life Laboratory"
 CHA_laboratory_desc:0 "Very few economists get to test their theories so directly, especially not failed ones, as Keynes do in Chad. Having received the largest subsidy in Chad's history from London, Keynes has begun a grand reforming of the economy, focusing on bringing people into the organized labor market, by artifically raising wages for road construction and given subsidies to the cotton farming that covers many a field in Chad.\n\nHis methods may be unconventional, but they have full validity and the country lies before Keynes to prove himself and overthrow the rotten and outdated consensus back in England."
 CHA_loaned_economy:0 "Loan Financed Economy"
 CHA_loaned_economy_desc:0 "Governor Keynes inherited his predecessor's economy, a weak and loan inflated wreck. This was not a part of the deal that Keynes had signed up to. Nevertheless, he has taken it as a further challenge, his theories are sound and have high predictive power, he can deal with any circumstance.\n\nSouth of Chad, lies the Oil River Colony, and they are not as convinced as Keynes is. They are the ones who have financed the former Governors waste and is now tasked with funding Keynes' crazy ideas. Keynes' know that he must act, to please the Nigerian colony, find some way to make them believe that he will repay the debts, but it wont be easy."

 cha.1.t:0 "Writing a Scientific Paper"
 cha.1.desc:0 "With this new project commenced, we should make make a report and have Keynes send in a paper to be published back in Cambridge. He could detail some of the successes and explain how his approach to govermental fiscial politics can lead to some amazing results and higher degree of control over variables important to measuring the economy, than usual laissez-faire methods can dream of.\n\nWork will begin shortly, with the paper being done within a month or two."

 cha.2.t:0 "Reflections on Political Economy"
 cha.2.desc:0 "ABSTRACT:\nThe economy of Chad has improved remarkably over the past few months, its growth has been substantially higher compared to similar colonies such as Mauritania and Libya. I then suggest this is due to the hands-on approach to public spending that the administration has taken.\n\nAccording to Dr. Smith (1934:686), Chad has no room for economic growth based on real valued assets, he argue 1) its population is too small (ibid:689), 2) not educated enough (ibid:691), 3) natural resources that are better produced elsewhere (ibid:695). All these claims are false.\n\nEarlier in 1936, a loan [1] was issued by the colonial administration to finance a larger investment into infrastructural projects. The goal was to employ more than 12 000 men and organize them into the labor market, to get them used to organized labor contracts. The efforts were more than successfull and the most recent estimates suggest the project employed close to 13700[2] (Robinson 1936:43). We see here that by organizing efforts across the country we can build a mileau of labor, where the native population helps each other to involve themselves in the economy, despite low literacy, literate and young people have been reported to help elder and illiterate read and sign contracts (ibid:58).\n\nConcerning the last claim, that resources in Chad are better produced elsewhere, we must admit uncertainty as the latest numbers have yet to be fully analysed, but initial reports indicate similar results to the above mentioned projects. I believe this to be sufficient evidence of the new direction of Chad's economy and the falsity of Smith's polemics, and strong evidence for my General Theory (Keynes 1935).\n\n(1)50 000 pounds sterling bound with a 5% interest rate\n(2)13681 (+/-50)\n\nKeynes, J.M. A General Theory on Employment, Interest and Money (1935),            unpublished doctoral dissertation, Cambridge.\nRobinson, J.

"Saharan Economics in Perspective"(1934) in Cambridge Journal               of Economics edition 44(4), pp. 685-709."

There could be many ways of solving this problem, and Keynes has a plan.

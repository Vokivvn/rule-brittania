PAT_Factional_Administration:0 "Factional Administration"
PAT_Factional_Administration_desc:0 "The administration of the Crown Colony of Patagonia is mostly handled by the settlers, the governor-general usually being selected from among the various families of Y Wladfa. After the death of the previous administrator and scrambling to find a replacement, more and more public support gathered around one Aneurin Bevan within the colony. The ascension of Carlow Reid has caused the administration of the colony to become almost deadlocked, and constantly in debate."
PAT_Violence_In_The_Mountains:0 "Violence In The Mountains"
PAT_Violence_In_The_Mountains_desc:0 "There are two sources of armed conflict, thievery and chaos in Patagonia. First and foremost is, of course, the Mapuche, the savage natives of Patagonia who have long been terrorising the settlers with their constant raids and killings. Second is the Fenians, who have been causing similar troubles in the name of Irish independence from the United Kingdom. While these threats are quite infuriating on their own, the harsh ethnic divide among the colony's official militia groups encourage more and more raids, murders and chaos in the colony."
PAT_The_Farming_Colony:0 "The Celtic Colony"
PAT_The_Farming_Colony_desc:0 "In the Colony of Patagonia, there are five main groups- the Irish, the Scottish, and the Welsh make up the largest numbers, with a handful of Germans as well. And of course the natives are ever-present. While the Celtic groups each have their own dreams for the future of the colony, the Germans are mostly content with working so long as no one interferes. The natives generally live in isolation from the colonists and would love nothing more than to be left alone and in peace in a land free from foreigners."
#leader descriptions
POLITICS_Charles_Carlow_Reid_DESC:0 "In a land divided along ethnic lines, where one wrong choice can lead to backlash from the several nationalities residing within the Territory's borders, one man was picked as the best administrator to govern Patagonia on behalf of the crown. That man was Charles Carlow Reid, a Scottish mining engineer who, rather surprisingly for a person who seems like a simple governor, has great plans for the southern tip of the American continent.\n\nReid belonged to one of the families coming from the heart of the Empire to the freezing lands of Patagonia. The discovery that it was rich in natural resources drove many of them to settle there, but this era of economic prosperity was not to last long. Eventually, the deposits of gold ran out, and trouble began brewing. Amidst this crisis, the young settler a far way from home became all the more important in the industry he specialized in. After his predecessor as governor of the Territory fell off a cliff, a replacement had to be found, and Charles Reid seemed to be just the man. Despite his lack of experience as a colonial official, his devotion to work and knowledge of the land, combined with the necessity to stop other, less friendly competitors from getting the position led to his being appointed as Governor.\n\nReid truly believes that Patagonia can revive the dream of the early 20th century, where men and women flooded into a land of opportunity. While he may not be the perfect person for his position, London has faith that he has the power, motivation and support to keep control, and prevent Aneurin Bevan and his Welsh allies from rising to power. All Reid wants is for his new home to be stable and safe."
POLITICS_Dan_Breen_DESC:0 "Dan Breen is not a settler. He hasn’t remained settled since the rickety ship took him and his mother to Patagonia from the fields of Tipperary. Since he read the writings of republicans before him. He has... sympathies with the Welsh and the Scots, after all, were they not oppressed under the Anglo foot too? But they were so... docile, so willing to collaborate with the English who took them under force. So, he employed violence. It wasn’t like he could go home anytime soon. So he and his followers came together and declared themselves the Fenians.\n\nThe Fenians started with just raids. Cows and sheep disappearing from wide pastures, spirited off with a message left behind in Irish, declaring that the Fenians were here to be heard. This moved onto murders. Not many, but a few, a man stabbed in the dark in the shops of Y Wladfa. The economic fallout from the disappearance of dozens of cattle and sheep had caused the already troubled colony left a mark, and the small militias of the colony were employed against the Fenians. But it didn’t work. No matter what, the Fenians evaded the militias.\n\nBut now, their day has come, and they won’t surrender. Against all odds, they will return home, by hook or by crook."
POLITICS_Conrad_von_Kaufungen_DESC:0 "Conrad von Kaufungen is a German man in Patagonia, born just south of what was eventually Y Wladfa. He worked as a farmhand, before failing to enter the administration of Patagonia. Von Kaufungen argued that this represented the oppression of Germans within Patagonia, riling up the population. He has now ascended to the leadership of Patagonia, declaring it a German territory."

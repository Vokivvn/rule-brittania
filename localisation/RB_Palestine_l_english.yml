 palestine.2.t:0 "Violence in Tulkarm"
 palestine.2.desc:0 "On the evening of April 15th, 1936, two Arabs constructed a roadblock on the road between Nablus and Tulkarm and began to stop cars and demand money and weapons. They told drivers they were gathering weapons and money for the Ilkwan al-Qassam, followers of the late Muslim preacher Izz ad-Din al-Qassam under the leadership of Farhan al-Sa'di. Two Jewish drivers and a Jewish passenger were separated from the rest of the drivers and shot. Two victims died and one survived.\n\nThe following night, two Arab laborers were killed near Petah Tikva, reportedly by members of the Jewish Irgun paramilitary, in an act of retaliation."

The city was full of demonstrations and protestors, with their numbers in the thousands, marching against the British government of Palestine and against the Arab attacks on Jews. All shops and factories have closed down in an act of solidarity with the Jews.\n\nThere have been reports of Arabs and Arab-owned property being assaulted by Jews in the city of Tel Aviv during this tumultuous day."

 palestine.4.desc:0 "April 19th started with rumors. Rumors that there was violence had broken out on the streets of Jaffa, that Arabs had been killed by Jews and that Jews have been killed by Arabs. In retaliation to these rumors, an Arab mob marched on to the Jewish-owned Anglo-Palestine Bank in Jaffa. The defending Viceroyalty police begun to fire into the crowd, inciting a fury that resulted in the murder of Jews on the streets.\n\n Two Arabs and Nine Jews were killed in the riots, with many of others injured and thousands of Jews fleeing the city as refugees. Finally, the local garrison marched on the city and ended the riots."

Today, leaders of the Arab National Committee called for a general strike of all Arabs engaged in labour, transport, and shopkeeping until further notice.\n\nThe strike is spreading throughout the country as Arabs participate in noncooperation as a form of protest. Already our economy has begun to take a toll."

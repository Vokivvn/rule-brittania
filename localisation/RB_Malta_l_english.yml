 POLITICS_CARMELO_PISANI_DESC:0 "Avanti Italia!\nForza Italia\n\nEver since he was a young boy, Carmelo Borg Pisani, he has hated the English, the Anglos, the British Empire. The Italian mainland has long been corrupted by the anglo temptation, and Malta has fallen too. Pisani sees it as his sacred duty to restore Italy, his way, the proud way.\n\nBorn on Malta 10. August 1914 to a well respected family, he was sent to Rome to study Latin, art and history. There he met with other Italian nationalists, and Maltese irredentists. He brought them back to Malta and formed the Maltese Falcons, an underground militia focused on restoring Malta, and Italy, to their deserved positions on the world stage, as bringers of morals and glory!"

Coming here with their fancy tea, dry biscuits and disgusting morals, they have promoted the so called 'British way of life'. Or as Pisani and his friends have dubbed it 'the fast track to hell. But Pisani and his blackshirts are here to change that, with blood, honor and glory. Avanti!"

 RULEBRITANNIA_NAME:0 "Rule Britannia!"
 RULEBRITANNIA_DESC:0 "The year is 1936, and the British Empire is at its peak. Never in all of history has any entity laid claim to such a vast amount of land. From the Port of Hong Kong, to the Dominion of California, all follows the reign of the King. From the freezing wastes of the Hudson Bay Company to the tropics of Australia, all men know the true meaning behind "empire". And from sea to shining sea, all watch tentatively, as the year 1936 rolls around: For it may very well be the last of the British Empire."

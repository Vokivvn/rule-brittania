 POR_RULEBRITANNIA_DESC:0 "Without a doubt, the Empire of Portugal stands in 1936 as the secondary world power, far behind Great Britain and marginally controlled by London, but still mighty in their own right. With the only other nation sustaining an overseas empire, Portugal has a strong economy and an ability to influence world events unparalleled by Britain’s colonies and satellite states. That being said, however, their dependence on British stability and the status quo leaves them in a vulnerable position, like being tied to a mighty ship that one prays does not sink."

 POR_The_Last_Independent_State_desc:0 "Many nations have fallen to the charm of British diplomats and their threats, or by the unfortunate way of calling the Empire's bluff. However, Portugal still stands as the only nation to have not fallen to Britain's clutches, maintaining our own rule from Lisboa that we so dearly love.\n\nWhile the Brits may have taken Brazil, while we may owe a lot of money to them, and while we may depend on them a lot for economic matters, that is of little importance! We are politically free from London, and we shall cherish that freedom until the day we die!"

As a traditionally militarist people, many Portuguese men enlist in the army every year upon coming of age, and jingoism is a commonly-accepted position among politicians.\n\nIn fact, the Emperor himself is a devout soldier and General in the army, earning him the epithet of the Soldier King. While British fleets rule the waves, Portuguese troops rule the land!"

And, unlike Britain's imperialist gluttony, this is enough for us.\n\nWe are perfectly happy carrying out the burden of the White man in Angola, Moçambique, and Zambezia, doing our duty to civilise the non-White to our standards. And, while the problems in Britain's system, merely benefiting the white man, are beginning to show, we still maintain a large amount of rule over our colonies, and will likely continue to for the years to come."
 
 ##Leader Descs##
 POLITICS_LUIS_II_DESC:0 "Prince Luís de Bragança lived a pampered life in Lisboa, growing up among family and being taught all sorts of things, such as history, mathematics, and other subjects. He was never expected to be Emperor, but that all changed on a cold day in 1908. On February first, 1908, the Emperor, his heir, and countless other direct members of the royal family were killed, as the Carbonária attempted to achieve their goal of a Portuguese Republic. However, Luís was alive, and he was prepared to get those radicals what they deserved. He ramped up the power of the monarchy and increased the powers of the state.\n\nHowever, Emperor Luís is not just an absolutist, but a militarist as well. Having served in the Anglo-Mexican War as leader of the Portuguese Expeditionary Force, he has never been one to separate military and politics, building Portugal's military as even more powerful than it already was. Emperor Luís is also not just a jingoist and an absolutist, but a nationalist, as well, waiting for the right time to destroy what little control of Portugal the British have."

 ##Events
 PKLuis.4.t:0 "Luis’ Ambitions"
 PKLuis.4.desc:0 "King Luis approached the podium, and looked at the thousands of his fellow countrymen that had gathered in the city square to hear him in this important speech. The crowd reached as far as the eye could see, but Luis was far from deterred by his popularity. Following a standing ovation as he was used to receiving, he began his speech. /n/n“Greetings, citizens of Lisboa and citizens of Portugal! As you all know, despite any tragedies our nation has faced, we have always survived them and overcome them, and we will continue doing so. Today, I have gathered you to speak of the future of our nation, and what I will do to help it in a dangerous world. /n/nFirstly, navies have always been the backbones of a grand colonial empire like ours. Without them, we would never traverse the oceans, send our goods to every corner of the world, and ensure our rightful lands overseas maintain order. However, the Portuguese navy has not lived up to its expectations, and is in dire need of modernization. The vessels in our possession are often old, and not on par with contemporary military technology, and so we will change that, with the help of our finest engineers. /n/nThe other project I have decided for the government to focus on in the coming months is one that the people are concerned in, and that is the development of Alentejo, a region in the south of our country that is still behind in terms of economic performance, and deserves a boost. As such, a revitalization of the regional economy will begin: new factories will be built, new mines opened, and more infrastructure constructed. I am sure the people of Alentejo will be grateful for this opportunity, and that it will be of help to all of us.”"
 PKLuis.4.a:0 "“Thank you for your attention.”"
 PKLuis.5.t:0 "Poor Alentejo..."
 PKLuis.5.desc:0 "A famous divide exists between the Portuguese lands that are north and those that are south of the river Tagus. The north is, thankfully, a heavily developed region, with many people living in it and enjoying a high quality of life, something expected of an area in Western Europe. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the south. In contrast with the rest of the country, it is underdeveloped, with poverty rampant, industry quite rare, and simply a lack of care for them by the government. /n/nThe King’s program is meant to fix this. Believing that an underdeveloped region of the homeland will be easy to build up, he has outlined his agenda to do just that. It will include numerous methods to do it, but will mainly revolve around better integrating the region and making it equal in status to the rest. This will be done through the construction of both industry and infrastructure, that are required to achieve the wanted result. And while our King certainly believes in the value of this project and its chances, and so do his advisors, there are suspicions that the reasons for the “Alentejo program” are political. It is a well-known fact that he is facing opposition from multiple factions competing for control, and popular support is not at an all-time high. Perhaps, by developing southern Portugal, he wishes to become a “King of the People”, who works for them and is beloved by them. Whether that will fix the other domestic problems we are facing is a different matter."
 PKLuis.5.a:0 "All of our country deserves equal economic opportunities."
 PKLuis.6.t:0 "Moroccan Ambitions"
 PKLuis.6.desc:0 "Morocco is a land Portugal has long had a desire to gain, yet that desire was never fulfilled in its entirety. Ever since the years of Afonso V “the African”, many parts of the Moroccan coastlines fell under our control, only to be later seized by another nation through peaceful or violent means. These nations have often been regional powers, but the latest conqueror of the Kingdom just across the Atlantic has been the British, and that is why an issue has appeared. /n/nKing Luis has made his intent to take Morocco clear, albeit only to his most trusted advisors and generals, citing our historical claims. However, it is obvious that, should such an invasion occur, the King of Morocco will immediately appeal to his British overlords for help, and our centuries-old alliance with London may be irreversibly scarred. For that reason, some members of the High Command and the Foreign Ministry have suggested trying a different approach, and that is diplomacy. We could be honest to the United Kingdom’s government, and make a negotiation to get a free hand in Morocco, as a reward for the King’s loyalty, or in exchange for a different concession./n/nOf course, there are always more clandestine approaches to geopolitics. One of these would be to utilize a possible falling out of the Moroccan King and his protectors. With some additional encouragement from us, it is possible that sooner or later, he will become hostile to them, and we will offer to “pacify the region”. Of course, this would only be an excuse to take it over, but it would likely be more acceptable to Britain."
 PKLuis.6.a:0 "No matter the way, we shall fight!"
 PKLuis.7.t:0 "A Request from Lisbon"
 PKLuis.7.desc:0 "The government of Portugal has long been under our influence, yet they often take the initiative and make decisions on their own. One of these decisions has just been made by King Luis, who recently contacted London, and stated that he wishes to get a free hand in the conquest of Morocco on behalf of his Empire. This was not expected by our government, but many of the recent developments have not been expected either./n/nLuis has stressed that Portugal has a historic claim to the Moroccan lands, and that he has chosen to take a friendly approach with us by conducting some sort of negotiation to allow the invasion. Specifically, he has offered to make a “mutually beneficial deal” - in compensation for allowing this colonial adventure, the United Kingdom will be granted the Canary Islands, just off the coast of Africa. It is no lie that this archipelago is a tempting possession to have, as it offers us yet another base for our army and navy, which will furthermore let us keep an eye on Portuguese Morocco, should Lisbon’s plans come to fruition./n/nSome have outright rejected this offer, believing it a blatant violation of our alliance, but many have responded positively, claiming that it will be a good way to keep both Portugal and Morocco loyal. Additionally, it is certainly a possibility that Luis will attempt an invasion anyway; in that case, wouldn’t it be better to be ready and get something out of it?"
 PKLuis.7.a:0 "Give them a free hand in Morocco."
 PKLuis.7.b:0 "Refuse to make any deal."

 ##Leader descriptions##
 POLITICS_ALEXANDRE_TECK_DESC:0 "Prince Alexandre of Teck - If one were to not ever meet Prince Alexandre, they’d probably think of him as a German. Considering his position in the House of Wurttemberg, residing as Duke of Teck Castle, many don’t see it out of the ordinary that he’d be offered the Crown of Burgundy. However, the fact is, Prince Alexandre is as English as it gets.\n\nBorn and educated in London, Alexander served in several colonial offices around his majesty’s empire. From California, to South Africa he has upheld the globally recognized standard of Britannia’s mighty army and her firm hand. Now, Alexandre watches over what may be his last position, and definitely his most honorable one. As the ceremonially styled “King” of the ever growing Crown of Burgundy, it’s his job to keep the nationally split territory loyal to London, so that the devious Huns and French may never threaten the Empire again."

 ##Tooltips##
 BRG_King_Ded_tt:0 "Princess Mary of Teck will be crowned the new Queen of Burgundy."
 BRG_Northern_States_tt:0 "We will make sure Luxembourg, Flanders, and Hainaut affirm their loyalties to the Crown."
 BRG_Central_States_tt:0 "We will make sure Artois, Champagne, and Picardy affirm their loyalties to the Crown."
 BRG_Eastern_States_tt:0 "We will make sure Alsace, Lorraine, and the Palatinate affirm their loyalties to the Crown."

 BRG_Idea_No_Ones_A_Burgundian:0 "No One's A Burgundian" 
 BRG_Idea_No_Ones_A_Burgundian_desc:0 "Seeing that Burgundy is a state split between a Rhenish and French population, lead by Württemberger King with allegiance to the British, it’s understandable why the country lacks a national identity.\n\nAs the country has grown throughout he past, more and more Burgundians see themselves patriotic to their region rather than the nation. All the while, the local governors prosper from this identity crisis."
 BRG_Idea_No_Ones_A_Burgundian_real:0 "No One's A Burgundian" 
 BRG_Idea_No_Ones_A_Burgundian_real_desc:0 "Seeing that Burgundy is a state split between a Rhenish and French population, lead by Württemberger King with allegiance to the British, it’s understandable why the country lacks a national identity.\n\nAs the country has grown throughout he past, more and more Burgundians see themselves patriotic to their region rather than the nation. All the while, the local governors prosper from this identity crisis."
 BRG_Idea_Cracker_Committee:0 "The Anglo-Burgundian Coordinating Committee"
 BRG_Idea_Cracker_Committee_desc:0 "Originally designed as a simple committee to oversee and maintain the British army camps in loyal Burgundy, the imperialist endeavors of the Empire has seen British involvement shrink to only the administrative aspects of the operation. Burgundian craftiness has seen the committee thrive in its new situation however.\n\nWhile the now mostly Burgundian Committee still operates Burgundy’s finest military academies, the British administration operates as Burgundy’s primary location to deal with the British, serving as mail delivery and the gateway to the Empire’s trade."
 BRG_Idea_Constituent_Countries:0 "The Burgundian System"
 BRG_Idea_Constituent_Countries_desc:0 "The Crown of Burgundy is split into various local governments each of them with various levels of independence. People in the Duchy of Burgundy for example, listen to the decisions of Alexandre I, but in Luxembourg, Alexandre I’s demands are only listened to if the Luxembourgish Monarch agrees to the demands, a situation echoed throughout the nation.\n\nThis agreement has led to some benefits however, as Burgundy has seen less ethnic tensions developing in its borders sans Alsace but overall, most politicians agree that Burgundy must see this system removed for the sake of Burgundy’s survival."

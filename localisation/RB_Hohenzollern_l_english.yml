 ##Leader Descriptions##
 POLITICS_WILHELM_II_DESC:0 "\"He’s the most remarkable man you will ever meet, a true hero of the Germanic race. He carries himself with the grace of a king without the decadence, with the wisdom of a scholar without the arrogance, with the power of a generalissimo without the thuggery. He is the father of our beloved Fatherland, and we are all his children.\" \n-Heinrich Himmler, captain in the Imperial Guard \n\nBorn on the 27th of January, 1859, the Prince of Hohenzollern has lived a turbulent life. Crippled from a young age due to complications during his birth, his short and turbulent reign as kaiser would see the final destruction of Prussian power in the 1890s following the final Anglo-Prussian war. Stripped of his titles and sent into exile, the experience would have a profound effect on the man, making him increasingly bitter and erratic. \n\nHe has since isolated himself within the confines of Hohenzollern castle, and surronded himself with fanatical German nationalists, stratocrats, and courtiers. While most of the world has long forgotten about the ousted Kaiser, he remains alive and constantly scheming for his return to the halls of power. \n\nFor within the halls of Hohenzollern castle, a great Heart of Darkness beats."

 ##Ideas##
 HOH_heart_of_darkness:0 "Heart of Darkness"
 HOH_heart_of_darkness_desc:0 "Fair Germany, a land of golden fields, green forests, and magnificent mountain peaks. A land of such great beauty and wonder, so scarred by war and terror. From the mighty Habsburg Empire in the East to the moribund Prussian Kingdom in the North, Germany remains as politically divided as ever.\n\nThe romantically inclined point to moments where this could have changed, moments when Germany could have united itself behind one man and one banner. Some say the Thirty Years War. Some say the Anglo-Prussian War. One man in particular believes the latter more than anyone else. \n\nIn the halls of Hohenzollern castle, in the court of a man the world has forgotten, lies a heart of darkness. From all over Germany and indeed the world, a select few make the pilgrimage to meet him, and to allow him to enlarge their minds with tales of military glory... and unholy revenge against his enemies."
 HOH_fanatical_stratocracy:0 "Fanatical Stratocracy"
 HOH_fanatical_stratocracy_desc:0 "For those outside of the walls of Hohenzollern castle, the vast quantity of weapons imported into the principality seems ludicrous. After all, the subjects of the territory remain some of the poorest in Europe, with levels of destitution only topped in the lands of the Russian Tsars. But those within the walls of the Castle, those who have heard Wilhelm speak, they understand why this is necessary. \n\nEvery morning those within the castle awake before the sun has even risen, already readying themselves for the day ahead. Before every princely breakfast a march is held in the Castle courtyard, as one by one his excellencies most loyal servants march to show their devotion. From the window of his study, he looks down on them, on the children that shall build the future of Germany."

 HOH_unclear_succession:0 "Unclear Succession"
 HOH_unclear_succession_desc:0 "In the parlors of London and Berlin, inhabited by those who remember our small principality, a common discussion on the matter of succession. Our Prince is a genius unparalleled, the greatest man of our age, a visionary among visionaries... yet he has undeniably reached a significantly advanced age. \n\nHis genius has gone... unrecognized by his former family, which has in turn led to them being fittingly removed from the line of succession. As day after day passes, one can not help but wonder if there is a future after our dear Prince."

 ##Events##
 hoh.1.t:0 "The Stranger"
 hoh.1.d:0 "It had become a weekly tradition for the four members of the Frankfurt Pan-German Society to meet at the tavern on Sunday night for a round of beer. All were in attendance tonight, the doctor, the lawyer, the soldier, and of course myself. We made merry and drank our fill, oblivious to the world around us as we talked about whether it would be Vienna or Berlin who would finally unite the German Volk. It was then that he came and sat down across from us. \n\nHe was a traveling artist, a man who seemed likely to wander the earth for all of his remaining days. I had seen him before, painting the landscapes around Frankfurt, though no attempt seemed to ever satisfy him. He scratched the pathetic mustache on his upper lip, before speaking to us. \"I suppose it must seem quite rude, for me to interrupt your talks on nationalism and unity, the Pan-German dream and all that. I can understand it myself truthfully, when I was a younger man I too held the same dreams. Mind you that was before I traveled to Hohenzollern Castle and met him, but I can still understand some of the romanticism of it.\" \n\nMy companions, clearly unhappy with the intrusion, left to find another table, but I remained, perhaps out of morbid curiosity more than anything else. He gazed at me, before speaking slowly. \"You asked whether it would be Berlin or Vienna who unified Germany? I can answer truthfully, it will be neither of them. Make no mistake, Germany will one day be united. I am certain of it, but I can not say with any confidence that this unity will be good for any of us.\""
 hoh.1.a:0 "\"For the men who will unify the nation, have within themselves the darkest hearts of all.\""
 hoh.2.t:0 "Arrival at Castle Hohenzollern"
 hoh.2.d:0 "He paused then, his previous sentence having been barely more than a whisper. Seeing that I was still listening, he laughed awkwardly, before continuing. /"As long as I can remember I have always wished to be an artist, it is my passion you see. Like all young men I had great dreams of what I would paint, and how centuries after my passing my work would still be cherished and beloved. Foolish dreams for a foolish man\" \n\nHe paused then, to refocus himself, before continuing. \"I received the letter by courier, a letter made of golden paper and red wax, marked with a seal that would become all to familiar. The wording was incredible, the promises it made wild and surreal in their scope. Three hot meals a day, room and board provided, six months of work to paint the entire castle landscape with a King’s ransom as payment. For the lowly son of a civil servant who had only ever painted by commission, I’m not ashamed to admit that I believed the man to be attempting to scam me. It was only his insistence and watery, pleading eyes that told me that every black letter was sincere.\"\n\n\"It took a week to arrange for my travel, and another week to reach the Castle. The train ran only to the town of Sigmaringen, from there it was several hours of walking and riding until at last I stood in front of the castle. It loomed over me, defiant in its rejection of modernity, a vast gothic monument to a time long passed. I must admit I was awestruck, so engrossed in its beauty that I missed the realities of the world around me. For several minutes I stared at it, until final I felt a hand pat me on the back. The courier from before! He had returned to the castle along with me. Gazing at it alongside me, he cleared his throat before speaking.\""
 hoh.2.a:0 "\"Come now, his highness does not accept loiterers\"."
 hoh.3.t:0 "The Two Horsemen"
 hoh.3.d:0 "\"It was a week after arrival that I first met them-\" \n\n\"The man you metioned before-\" I interrupted him then, my own curiosity overcoming my manners. \"-that certain \"him\". He shook his head then, and took a sip from his drink before continuing. \n\n\"No, no they where not... you will know when I reach him I assure you. The two men I met that day in the courtyard, they were simply servants of him, bureaucrats, explicitly dangerous and cunning, but still just bureaucrats. They were military men, some of the first to make the journey to the castle and task themselves with the mission, true believers in the cause if you will. Erich von Ludendorff and Max Bauer, that was their names, the twin heads of a single viper. The former, an elderly self styled Field Marshal, and the latter his protege. A world of differences lay between them, but within the confines of their mind the same foul machine ran.\" \n\n\"They introduced themselves then, their polite smiles and charitable words hiding the contempt they held in their hearts towards the so called \"civilian elements\". They were almost always together, the feebleness of Ludendorff necessitated Bauer’s support. For a brief moment we discussed the time and the weather, before the sound of a church bell ringing made us all fall silent. They gazed up towards a window on the fourth floor for what felt like hours made out of seconds, before blinking and returning their gaze to me. We parted ways afterwards, my heart once again unknowingly deaf to the surrounding darkness\""
 hoh.3.a:0 "\"How strange...\""
 hoh.4.t:0 "The First Meeting"
 hoh.4.d:0 "\"It was then that I first laid eyes on him, the man who I had heard so much about since my arrival. His shadow you see, it loomed larger than any man I’ve ever met, on every cold surface and hot fire it lay. The Castle staff, the visitors there, and even the military men with their chests covered with medals of heroism and valor, all spoke of him incessantly. Even the courier who had originally brought me, I later learned, was an adroit supporter of him, with a devotion lying somewhere between jealous obsession and intellectual zealotry. I shouldn’t speak so poorly of the man I suppose, despite all of his many, many flaws, he was the closest thing I had to a friend there.\" \n\n\"Now where was I- oh yes, the first time my eyes ever met his. It was during one of the morning marches, when everyone from the closest confidant to the lowest servant was instructed to goose step around the Castle courtyard, that I saw him. The fourth story window, the one which the twin vipers had stared at with such longing, was where he first appeared. A silhouette dressed in a flowing white nightgown, his figure slender and gaunt with age. The entire march fell silent, everyone standing in anticipation for his next command, biting their teeth. After a moment's pause, he raised his hand in salute, the same salute given by Roman conquerors and tyrants to their soldiers. We all responded in kind, and with one single great voice shouted:\""
 hoh.4.a:0 "\"Hail! Hail his Highness!\""

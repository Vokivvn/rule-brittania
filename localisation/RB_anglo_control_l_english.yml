  eng_gorg_desc:0 "Today, the British Empire mourns the passing of its proud sovereign. George V, King by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands, King of the Realms and Commonwealths of the British Empire, Defender of the Faith and Protector of the Commonwealth of Earth has passed away in his sleep tonight. The legal hour of death has been established as being 4:30 AM. The Royal Household, and the British Empire as a whole now enter a period of mourning as Prince David Windsor prepares to address Parliament ahead of his coronation. Though the Empire is in shock from the passing of such a powerful and beloved monarch, the regular procedures in place for the succession are being enacted orderly. Crowds of loyal subjects across the Empire attend an extraordinary, synchronized mass in churches from London to the farthest outpost of the Empire, led in prayer via radio by the Archbishop of Canterbury, as the Royal Constabularies prepare to disperse any anarchist or unpatriotic swine desecrating the occasion."

 ETH_fire_colony:0 "Fire Colony"
 ETH_fire_colony_desc:0 "Kenya produces tea.\nUganda produces coffee.\nThey produce a lot in Somalia.\nEgypt makes cotton.\nSudan makes leather.\n\nEthiopia? Ethiopia makes fire, blood puddles, smoke and chaos. Estimates are worryingly spread, some believe that the organized resistance is crushed, but they fail to really explain how regularly the attacks happen. But there are no proofs that they are connected, so the command are unsure what to do. The attacks keep coming anyways."
 ETH_military_discipline:0 "Military Discipline"
 ETH_military_discipline_desc:0 "The Army has grown in size and with the increased opposition to our rule, discipline has become more important. Making the average soldier in Ethiopia among the best soldiers in the world, at least in Africa, well used to the heat and knowledgable of the steep and mountainous terrain to covers the land."

 eth.1.t:0 "The Protectorate"
 eth.1.desc:0 "After two wars Ethiopia is finally pacified! While the first was hard, the second proved harder. The army that garrisons Ethiopia today was en route to improve coverage all across east Africa, when Haile Sellaise got his realm to rise up against British rule. He got what he deserved, a real crackdown. The Army had to make an example of Ethiopia, to what happens when crossing lines with the Empire. Despite being supposed to be spread all over, policing demands have remained too high for the Army to go off its duty in Ethiopia.\n\nMilitary occupation is expensive, very expensive and the protectorate is just barely making it on the scraps it get from London. The army is still doing all right, as it in addition to regular military pensions live of the land and what it brings, be it maize, ale or goods of other sorts. But resistance is getting fiercer and unless London steps up and gives in to the Army's demands, officers are getting worried that something is coming, and possibly quick..."
 eth.1.a:0 "A solution should be nearby"

 eth.2.t:0 "State of the Army"
 eth.2.desc:0 "After years of operating in the harsh hills and mountains of Ethiopia, the Army has become veterans, some of the best and most hardened troops across the Empire. New and difficult challanges the officers to be creative and develop methods to efficiently track down and stop the bandits from ripping Ethiopia apart. The resistance towards our rule fluctuates weekly, but over the past year it has grown more rapidly, and a few are really worried it might be the prelude to another major conflict.\n\nThey are probably wrong, given the increasing skill and experience of our force. And with the East Africa Squadrons marine corps just east, we can probably hold of anything at this point."
 eth.2.a:0 "For the King"

 eth.3.t:0 "Demonstration in Addis Ababa"
 eth.3.desc:0 "A weekly affair, this. Demonstrations in the street, they happen too often and have too many supporters to effectively outlaw. Our jails are nearing maximal capacity, and the stock of suited guards are being thinned out as new jails open across the country.The demonstrations are demanding increasingly more, fairer judicial processes, more just taxation, less British police around, restoration of the Emperor, withdrawal of all British forces, where will it end?\n\nNone of these demands are reasonable by any book, but completely ignoring them could lead to unknown consequences, and we cant afford that."
 eth.3.a:0 "Stop at once!"
 eth.3.b:0 "For the King"

 eth.4.t:0 "Soldiers Kidnapped"
 eth.4.desc:0 "It was early morning when five soldiers overseeing a food transport got overrun by Ethiopian bandits and kidnapped. Usually, these sorts of situations result in some demands, often of the type 'Restoration of his Majesty to the throne' and then a quick investiagtion and a squad of marines blowing up the bandit's hole with artillery, well within regulated limits of collateral damage.\n\nThis time, no such demands have arrived, nor any other such demands, for supplies or ransom."
 eth.4.a:0 "Get our boys home!"

 eth.5.t:0 "Depot Raid"
 eth.5.desc:0 "During a guard switch, they striked. A large band of bandits, quickly and without too much fuss, broke into one of the army's weapon depots and got away with a couple of crates with new guns. The responsible officer has been demoted and the surviving guards have been resigned to save their health and avoid the risk now associated with these useless slobs.\n\nThe Governor wished this was the first time it had ever happend, but fact is, that such occurances were commonplace, but every other week or so: another raid, more abductions, new murders, or devestating arson."
 eth.5.a:0 "We have more in the stock"

 eth.6.t:0 "Funeral Ceremony"
 eth.6.desc:0 "The King is dead. King George V became 70 years, having ruled for 26 years. His rule saw the second Anglo-Ethiopian war, and the dismanteling of the Ethiopian empire. What was once an exemplary protectorate in east Africa, with cordial collaboration and extensive trade agreements, things were set up very favorably for the Ethiopians.\n\nLast week he died, and a ceremony were to be held this day in all countries across the globe. In Addis Ababa, some dumb youths had decided to join the resistance and make as much trouble on this day as they could. Pistols were shot, guards were killed, and governal figures were hastedly evacuated away from the scene. The boys were never caugth, and certain streets have been put under heavy military control, only allowing transit if carrying a special permit.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a beautiful and honorable ceremony to a great King turnt into chaos, and the people of Ethiopia must pay for it!"
 eth.6.a:0 "Damn rebels!"

 eth.7.t:0 "Railway sabotage!"
 eth.7.desc:0 "Between Addis Ababa and Djibouti is our lifeline, vital supplies come in by train every day, and everyday runs the risk of this line being compromised. This was such a day. At four different spots, what seems to be, a planned attack damaged the rail and broke the connections between sections of tracks, making transport impossible and delaying the scheduled delivery of tons of food and ammunition."
 eth.7.a:0 "Get on that, captain!"

 eth.8.t:0 "Monarchists in the street"
 eth.8.desc:0 "For the first time in years does Ethiopians openly march in the streets, as they demand the british military rule to step aside and let them crown their emperor."
 eth.8.a:0 "Get them home"

 eth.9.t:0 "Third Anglo-Ethiopian War"
 eth.9.desc:0 "Reports are incoming, Harar, Gonder, Bahir Dar have all been overrun in what seems to be an organized operation. The Army is in high alert and ready to defend the protectorate. It shouldn't have come to this, something different should have been done at some point, but with a crisis on our hands, we have no time to linger on past mistakes. We must set our focus on future decisions, on how to win this war and guard our colony from further chaos.\n\nIn hindsight we should have been more prepared. It never seemed like the natives would accept our rule and when we put guns behind our words, the people got mad."
 eth.9.a:0 "Not again..."

 eth.10.t:0 "A Hard Decision"
 eth.10.desc:0 "War has broke out, troops are marching all over, plans are being tossed away, as resistance is being met at every corner. The time has come to choose, do you want to try to keep British rule in Ethiopia, or is the cause lost? Do you stick with the English military or the Ethiopian resistance movement?"
 eth.10.a:0 "Never! (Play as Ethiopia)"
 eth.10.b:0 "For the Emperor! (Play as Abyssinia)"

 eth.11.t:0 "Curfew time"
 eth.11.desc:0 "The Army Command has decided that noone will be allowed to walk outside after 2200, unless carrying a valid permission, signed by a British official. The decree comes after a period of increased reports of groups of men walking around in Addis Ababa before and after criminal incidents occurring. For the time being the curfew is announced to last two weeks.\n\nThere will be some backlash, but we have prepared for this, it should not be anything out of the ordinary."
 eth.11.a:0 "Stay home"

 eth.13.t:0 "Curfew tightens"
 eth.13.desc:0 "The past weeks events have necessitated a tightening of the recent curfew, pushing the time back to 1900. This should be a reasonable time, we feel that this should be sufficient for people to come back from their work or tea dates, or whatever they do."
 eth.13.a:0 "Sorry that it has to be this way.."

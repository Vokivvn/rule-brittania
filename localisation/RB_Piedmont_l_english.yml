 POLITICS_FERDINANDO_II_DESC:0 "With the previous ruler, Duke Tommasso, passing away and Prince Ferdinando ascending on the throne, many of the intellectuals and thinkers, as well as the most visionary advisors of the Turinese court, put their best exceptations for the new monarch. As it always occurs to a new ruler, the people expected from the newly crowned Duke to encourage the most daring changes, be it a break with the most hated Albion, the reformation of the army as a capable force in its own right, revoking privileges of the naval aristocrats, even pursuing the vision of a Greater Italy and other, often contradictory, reforms.\n\nOf course, all those good hopes were not destined to come true. Ever since his first days on the throne, His Royal Highness Ferdinando did not try to hide his intentions to continue to rule according to the principles of his good and God-fearing father, the principles in accordance with which the Savoy dynasty ruled for a long time and the ones that shaped their Duchy in its current form. The ties with the British Empire, a long-standing ally of Savoy and the guarantor of its power, have never been so tight as it became under Duke Ferdinando. The Admiralty, the pride and dignity of the Duchy, strengthened its role as the ruling caste and even more supplanted the neglected and understaffed army. Even having the most secure position on the peninsula, Ferdinando never used an opportunity to accomplish himself as the Italian unifier and was merely satisfied with what his Duchy provided to him.\n\nBut unlike the poets and revolutionaries of Savoy, Duke Ferdinando does not see a reason to worry for the future. After all, the good friends from London help him to realize his life passion for the mighty navy that is capable to defend the shores without any need for a numerous army and the domestic situation has never been more beneficial for his class than it was ever before. Truly, only a miracle, or a disaster, is capable to disturb the natural order of things prevailing in Savoy and convince the Duke in the necessity for radical shifts."

 pie_dukes_retinue_desc:0 "Through generations, the army of Savoy has been rather lacking, failing to meet any proper standards of an army. Even the new lands gained haven’t been touched, leaving the Duchy with little greater of an army than just the Duke’s retinue."

 #Leader Descriptions
 POLITICS_YI_UN_DESC:0 "The second Yi to reign over Korea in the 20th century, Yi Un ( Romanized as King Yŏngch'inwang) has presided over the continued period of prosperity. In contrast to his fellow, long-lived, Asian neighbors, Yi Un has fully embraced Western ideals and made a happy acquaintance with his British equals. This Westernization initiative has led to many successes, such as the East’s largest and most modern navy, a new constitution which led to its status as a Kingdom, and a booming population. He has also personified this, having enrolled in Sandhurst and speaking with English aristocracy regularly and in fluent English..\n\nHowever, this success would’ve never been likely had he not been selected over his older brother as the successor to the Emperor Yunghui: a succession allowed due to favorable court politics. Taking this lesson into account, Yi Un always keeps his cards close while working with his government, lest he end up unpopular like his dethroned brother. However, make no mistake, Yi Un’s future is bright along with that of the nation he leads."

#Ideas
KOR_raids1:0 "Manchurian Raids"
KOR_raids1_desc:0 "Manchuria is hardly anarchic: the Qing’s base of power is cemented there. However, bandits still find ample opportunity to make the most out of the lawless rural British Far East and Manchuria’s vast steppes, making Korean lives in the north quite difficult."
KOR_raids2:0 "Intensified Raids"
KOR_anglo_megacorps2:0 "Chaebŏl Economy - Strong"
KOR_anglo_megacorps2_desc:0 "The Chaebŏls are behind most investments, ventures, and industrial growth in the Choson peninsula. Ironically, these corporations are scarcely Korean in origin. Vickers, Rolls-Royce, and many other British companies have made their home in the nation, finding the growing working-class and population suitable for their interests. Perhaps expectedly, this development scheme serves only to frustrate domestic attempts at achieving industrial growth, something which the Board of Advisors will have to consider as the 30s continue."
KOR_advisor_board2:0 "The Board of Advisors - Balanced"
KOR_advisor_board2_desc:0 "The Board of Advisors is a mix between the cabinet of the King and his British entourage of capitalists and technocrats. Heavily pro-British in interest, they conflict with the other court members on a daily basis, and even with the King himself occasionally. Nonetheless, it can not be overstated how influential the Board is on determining policy in the Kingdom."
KOR_advisor_board3:0 "The Board of Advisors - Controlling"
KOR_on_the_rise:0 "Korea on the Rise"
KOR_on_the_rise_desc:0 "The bustling economy, improved standards of living, and Westernization campaigns have all led to a Korea on the world-stage. Compared to its backwater, decrepit Chinese neighbor and its tumultuous, modernizing Japanese rival, Korea is on top of them all. It is quite possible that Korea, with its large navy and substantial influence over northeastern Asia, could eclipse its neighbors totally and establish itself as the foremost Asian power."

While the East Asia Fleet has several great ships and could easily beat any navy anywhere; you know what they say? Nne destroyer turns into five cruisers by next winter, and once we allow Korea this liberty, the Chinese will want it, the Japanese will want it. Soon enough, the Europeans will know about it, and they will demand it, they cant have less than the asians, they would say. No, the wise decision is to shut this down before it begins."

Ri has noted himself as a staunch opposer of the intensified raids, that have been occuring the past few weeks. He has gone as far as saying off the record that he considers military action necessary to curb these raids. Noting the weak position of the Emperor in Peking, he believes it is best to just bypass Him and move troops in to secure a suitable parameter to defend our citizens, and their homes south of the border.That would constitute a deep legal and diplomatical aggression and is not in Korea's interest, however putting pressure on the Emperor to allow Korean police and military units to guard the border would be within bounds.\n\nMany oppose this blunt plan, and think it would be wiser to move more cautiously forward. They recommend opening up discussions with the Emperor, so he could put pressure on the Viceroy of Manchuria such that he could take measures against the raidings."

A letter was sent yesterday to the Emperor of China to have him grant a strip of land that the general staff has deemed appropriate to defend the population south of the border. Permissions from the British Empire for our demands have already been granted, including an extended permission to engange in military operations to counter any further raids or no granted demands."

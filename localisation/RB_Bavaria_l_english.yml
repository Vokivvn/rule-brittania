 #Ideas
 ger_eng_ger_economic_initiative_bav:0 "Anglo-German Economic Initiative"
 ger_eng_ger_economic_initiative_bav_desc:0 "loc here"
 BAV_Founder_of_the_AGEI:0 "Founder of the AGEI"
 BAV_Founder_of_the_AGEI_desc:0 "In 1906, at a large convention in the Viceroyalty of Hannover, an agreement was signed between Bavaria and the British Empire. This agreement outlined ordinances of free trade, currency integration, and economic protocols that would direct our foreign policy for the next three decades.\n\nWith varying effects on our economic, foreign, and to an extent, local affairs, the formation of the Anglo-Germanic Economic Initiative has been fairly controversial. It must be realized, that as long as we remain within the agreement, the state of our geopolitical position is affirmed: Purely Pro-Britain."
 BAV_Imperial_Economic_Integration:0 "Imperial Economic Integration"
 BAV_Imperial_Economic_Integration_desc:0 "Bavarian Motors, Food, and Money are the lifeblood of Britain’s role in our Kingdom. This has put us in a more-than-close relationship with the empire.\n\nIt has gotten to the point that the Bavarian Gulden, a currency that has traversed all of South Germany and much of the Rhine, is heavily reliant on the British Pound. Economists claim that this could result in a potentially catastrophic collapse in the case of a British recession, but their cries have been drowned out by 30 years of unqualified economic boom."
 BAV_Panther_of_the_South:0 "The Panther of the South"
 BAV_Panther_of_the_South_desc:0 "Established in 1681, the Bavarian Army has proved itself to be an effective force in maintaining the regional dominance of the Kingdom.\n\nLead by Chief of Staff, Konrad Krafft von Dellmensingen, the army effectively supported their British allies during the Anglo-Prussian, and later the Fourth Anglo-French war, played decisive roles in multiple key battles. Most famously, at the Battle of Langensalza, Dellegsman was able to link up with a small Hanoverian army to the north and force retreat unto the Prussian army. \n\nWith allies to the South, the British to the North, and the French pacified in the West, it seems that the Panther of the South will maintain its military prowess for years to come."
 BAV_Volkskrone:0 "The Bavarian Volkskrone"
 BAV_Volkskrone_desc:0 "The Bavarian Estate Assembly is perhaps the most progressive in Central Europe. Modeled after British Parliament, the government has established a bicameral governing system, with both a House of Lords (Kammer der Reichsräte) and a House of Commons (Kammer der Abgeordneten).\n\nFor the most part, this system helps ensure a relative balance of power between the King, the nobility, and the citizens of Bavaria. Some however, claim the Estates Assembly as corrupt and favorable of the landowner-industrialist minority. This has lead to talk of a formal constitution and evolution of the Assembly into a full Parliament."

 #Leader Description
 POLITICS_RUPPRECHT_I_DESC:0 "King Rupprecht reigns over the richest domain within the collection of states known as Germany. Succeeding his late father in 1921, Rupprecht has managed to continue progress that made Bavaria a regional power, and has even gone beyond the expectations of all experts with his ability to overtake the Prussian economy. In addition, his move to drop the Jacobite claim upon his coronation has made him popular among British diplomats, which allowed for him to become a staunch ally of the British crown.\n\nHe has also proven himself in his own right, bringing about reforms and a Constitution for Bavaria unlike his rather conservative father. Allowing for the Landtag to take shape and for his powers to be reduced by this newly-appointed Parliament, he has led to a popular Bavarian idiom of “Volkskrone”, or the people’s crown. In addition to his liberalization of the political system, Rupprecht has proven himself to be a competent commander and even with his limited military command in Turkey and Mexico, he has proven himself to be a bright star among the rather decadent British generals who dominate the tactics taught at most academies. Clearly, Rupprecht is poised to have the suffix of “the Great” added once his time on Earth ends.\n\nHowever, deep in his heart, Rupprecht wishes Germany could be whole, rather than divided and exploited. He is willing to work with Britain to achieve this, preferring to continue making a profit off Bavarian aircraft manufacturing and other sources of income rather than to squander the nation’s wealth. However, the Hohenzollern monarchy of the north and the Habsburg monarchy of the east pose a threat to the South German kingdom, as their growing anti-British sentiment may lead to conflict across Germany once again. In an almost divinely-mandated task, Rupprecht must steer the ship of Germany towards calm waters away from radicalism and preserve its good fortune, lest he end up like August Wilhelm."

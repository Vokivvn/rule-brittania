 KEN_mombasa_port_i_desc:0 "Mombasa has one of the largest ports in East Africa, operating thousands of containers every day, as a central hub between Southern and East Africa and India. But in addition to tonnage, people are coming into the port; a few hundred per year are moving to Kenya to live life to its fullest, live out the ancient feeling of relaxation, far away from the stress in London."

 KEN_native_resistance_i_desc:0 "Getting the most fertile land around your home taken away, and you deported to some place you have never been, just so some rich man can build a house there, is not something anyone likes. The Kenyans hate it, with fury. The Kenyan opposition is well organized, but due to relatively effective policing, the outcomes of the resistance arent much to brag about. Should the situation arise, though, cells scattered across the land could rise up."

For over 50 years British settlers has cultivated this marvellous piece of land, developed farming techniques and built their homes. Life in Kenya is the best in East Africa, possibly in all of Africa, probably even best in the world, here Brits can live in peace, away from Londons thick smog and shady politics, no dirty labour unions to stop us, no national army to conscript our sons. Some anthropologes say man walked out of Africa millions of years ago, they surely came from Kenya."

 ken.4.desc:0 "The natives in Ethiopia, loyalists to the pretender for the Ethiopian throne, has risen up in armed revolt. Long have they made life hard for the poor garrison there, by punishing weak discipline, sabotaging facilities and murdering soldiers.\n\nWe have seen this coming, and been sending reports about such activities to HQ in Djibouti, but to no avail, the garrison was woefully unprepared for this, despite their sharpest efforts. There isnt much we can do at the moment, while we anticipate some opposition to our plan to carve out a new settlement zone east in the country. But we can send a few spare guns, should we keep them in case we need to show force or should Ethiopia be put first right now? "

 ken.6.t:0 "Scheme from East Africa Company"
 ken.6.desc:0 "The newspapers in Nairobi have gone raving when chairman of the East Africa Company, Oliver Stanley, announced in a press conference that 'Big plans' for Nairobi were soon to be revealed. The exact details of what those plans are unclear, however, it was noted that the East Africa Company had just engaged in a purchase of an old warehouse in the industrial center of the city. Stanley was reportedly excited about his big plan, stating 'It's something that you never seen before'.\n\nA few days after the press conference the old warehouse and its surrounding property was cordoned off, to make way for the lines of construction vehicles, trucks, and workmen. Many individuals, mostly reporters, had tried to enter the property to find out exactly what all these people are building, all attempts at entry were blocked. Attempts at interviewing workers while off-site were also unfruitful, only getting answers stating that their contract included a “code of silence” for what exactly they were working on, and would both be fired and fined were they to reveal it. These reports prompted even excitement and rumors, and culminated in a pair of ill-advised reporters climbing the fence during night to see what was going on. The pair were both caught a mere few minutes later by a watchman who was on patrol. In the few minutes the two were unable to find much, but, they were able to discover that there was large amounts of technical machinery inside the complex."

 ken.10.desc:0 "Kenya is home to thousands of animals, large, exotic, dangerous, majestic. Kenya is prized for its great diversity, among others: The buffalo, the african elephant, the lion, leopards, rhinos, anthelopes of all kinds, zebras, giraffes, ostriches, hyenas, wildebeest, vultures, cheetas, crocodiles, bamboons, hippos and many others.\n\nFor a grand price, thousands of British pounds sterling, people from England can come visit the Kenyan highlands and search for these beasts, perhaps even do a little hunt. Every now and then, these safaris enter areas reserved for black pastoral operations, and every time this happens, uproar and unrest break loose as the black population feel that their 'rights to the land' are being violated, that their livelyhood is being marginalized in favor for the pleasure of rich white men. These issues are always easy to fix, by reducing these zones so safaris never go into reservations again."

 ken.11.desc:0 "News trickled in to Nairobi from the small town of Homa Bay, a settlement on Lake Victoria.

The mailman, a young lad who was delivering a package, found the door open and decided to enter to drop off his package, when he looked to the room left of the foyer he saw the body. The official coroners stated that the death was caused by a d blunt force trauma to the skull. There were however various other wounds on the body, signifying that there had been some sort of struggle where the mayor fall onto the sofa, where he was repeatedly bashed in the head with a blunt object.\n\nWho the murderer(s?) was is still unclear, as the local population has not been able to produce any meaningful clues. Investigators believe this murder may have connections with the Kenyan Land and Freedom Army, as his upstairs office was ransacked and all the drawers emptied and thousands of papers floating on the floor."

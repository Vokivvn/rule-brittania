 ##Ideas##
 COU_british_controlled_economy:0 "British Controlled Economy"
 COU_british_controlled_economy_desc:0 "Courland’s economy has largely relied on fur and timber exports throughout its existence, and with the emerging industrial technology further looming ahead and leaving our goods being unable to keep up with competitors, along with there being a massive lack of any other forms of industries, making our economy look comparable to that of a microstate to our neighbours and the rest of the world."
 COU_couronian_identity:0 "Couronian Identity"
 COU_couronian_identity_desc:0 "Centuries of being separate from our Baltic brethren eventually resulted in the birth of our own Couronian culture, combined with our own German dialect on the parts of our coast and in our capital. Such an achievement has led to a foreboding sense of nationalism and patriotism amongst our populace."
 COU_serfdom_entrenched:0 "Serfdom Entrenched"
 COU_serfdom_entrenched_desc:0 "The Privilegium Gotthardinum decree was signed in 1570, allowing landholders to enserf the native populace for their own needs. Ever since the British have asserted their rule over Courland, the law was never repealed and has been entrenched through the efforts of the influential landholders and nobility, leaving the working class enslaved and bitter, and forming another barrier that is stopping Courland from effectively industrialising."

 COU_economic_reconstruction:0 "Economic Reconstruction"
 COU_economic_reconstruction_desc:0 "Political turmoil may not totally be over in our government, however a push for finally stabilising the economy after the collapse of British influence over the globe can finally be achieved, as no longer there are massive monopolies over our industries. The question now lies on how we will develop our industry."
 COU_move_agrarianism:0 "Move onto Agrarianism"
 COU_move_agrarianism_desc:0 "Courland was left with the short end of the stick in terms of natural resources, however, we have lots of fertile, undeveloped land that is literally ripe for the taking. The majority of our government agrees that we should prioritise sowing the seeds instead of dumping massive concrete structures everywhere."
 COU_private_farmsteads:0 "Invest in Private Farmsteads"
 COU_private_farmsteads_desc:0 "The majority of our agricultural industry is made up of private ranches and farmsteads owned by peasants, who tend to be too poor to expand their fields. By expanding local infrastructure and issuing government grants, we can encourage a trend in business ownership.A major obstacle for expanding businesses are the absurd property prices and legislation tied to owning a single building alone. We can fix this by simplifying the bureaucracy and instituting a price cap depending on the size of the property to help out the struggling peasantry."
 COU_property_legislation:0 "Reorganise Property Legislation"
 COU_property_legislation_desc:0 "A major obstacle for expanding businesses are the absurd property prices and legislation tied to owning a single building alone. We can fix this by simplifying the bureaucracy and instituting a price cap depending on the size of the property to help out the struggling peasantry."
 COU_import_equipment:0 "Import New Farming Equipment"
 COU_import_equipment_desc:0 "Now that our peasantry owns far more farmland than the decades before and business is booming, it's time to further elevate the trend by importing farming equipment from Germany and Scandinavia to maximise the efficiency of our agriculture."
 COU_stimulate_market:0 "Simulate the Food Market"
 COU_stimulate_market_desc:0 "Our food industry by this point has reached a status that we now have one of the biggest food markets in northern Europe, but prices for some crops are still unbalanced, infrastructure to the farmland is still poor and there is no extensive food safety legislation. It's time for another change."
 COU_roadways_east:0 "Roadways into the East"
 COU_roadways_east_desc:0 "Lest we not forget our extensive logging industry, particularly prominent in Semigallia and Rositten, yet there are no highways or even roads going into some parts where logging companies are the most prominent. A simple solution is to provide grants to the local corporations, and finally connecting Daugava to the west with a direct route."
 COU_semigala_mines:0 "Semigallian Mines"
 COU_semigala_mines_desc:0 "An unexpected discovery is that in the deepest depths of the Daugavan wilderness are small traces of ore, just begging to be tapped in. Exploiting such reserve could mean a small but useful boost to our further growing economy."
 COU_breadbasket_state:0 "Breadbasket of the Baltic"
 COU_breadbasket_state_desc:0 "Food production in Courland is close to now that of the Netherlands, and is now the biggest in the entire Baltic states. It's only a matter of time before our crops reach every end of the globe, and Couronian bread will become a household favourite."
 COU_purchase_ships:0 "Purchase Danish Ships"
 COU_purchase_ships_desc:0 "The Danish and the Norwegians enjoy the largest merchant fleet in the entire world, meanwhile we struggle to meet our exports due to our outdated and outnumbered cargo ship fleet. Surely we can reach a deal with Copenhagen to solve this problem, right?"
 COU_mitau_institute:0 "Mitau Research Institute"
 COU_mitau_institute_desc:0 "We can't solely rely on importing and copying technological marvels from around the world, and expect to not make our mark on innovation. Numerous professors from the college of Mitau propose establishing a institute for innovative research in the capital to hopefully start our own series of research projects."
 COU_initiate_industrialisation:0 "Initiate Industrialisation"
 COU_initiate_industrialisation_desc:0 "The landlords are gone, but with it we now have lots of affordable labour and a lack of any industry. We can kickstart our push to revive the economy with subsidising what little factories we have, and hopefully those businesses will swell in size and more businesses will be birthed."

 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_BERNARD_MONTGOMERY_DESC:0 "Initially not considered the first pick, Bernard Montgomery was a black horse in the race to control one of the most important dominions of the Empire - the heartland of their long-standing cultural enemy, France. To receive such a high honor was something he had accepted without hesitation, with the reputation of his skill in wars backing his position as the sole ruler - a man that rules like a general commands their army.\n\nThough he is, in the end, a military man at heart. His mind does not lie in politics, but rather in the battlefield and in the war room, strategizing not about the construction of industry or of crafting political webs, but drawing battle plans and theory-crafting about how to use forces to their maximum effectiveness. He is a byproduct of the omnipresent British nepotism, and within him only a sort of half-hearted attempt at ruling France lay. Though not the most incompetent ruler, Montgomery’s infamous lack of tact and diplomacy has made his mere presence wary to the remnants of the French government, outright hostility being avoided only by the Empire’s iron fist looming above them, as well as Montgomery’s unmatched skill in crushing resistance cells. Under his rule, life for the French citizen is not too different to what it was before, except now any semblance of self-determination was under Anglo yoke, effectively reduced to nothing but scattered atoms.\n\nHis personality, however, does show in his manner of ruling. Though barely tolerating - and being tolerated by - the elites, one could argue that Montgomery knows how to keep a civilian population suppressed, with extensively planned-out military patrols and deep investigative efforts into any possibility of resistance. This, for now, has kept the peace, even though the populace’s discontentment has grown more and more as time passes. Dissent is growing and the situation is deteriorating as resistance groups are nearing open revolt, but everyone knows, and so does Montgomery. Will there truly be peace in his time, or will Britain’s enemy break their deadlock? "

 FRA_London_Loyalty:0 "Act of London Loyalty"
 FRA_London_Loyalty_desc:0 "The 1889 act of London Loyalty states that the British occupational garrison of the French territories and the Paris administration is legally allowed to meddle in the affairs of the Paris civilian administration in the case of emergency of suspicion of treachery. This act, created after the failure of the third revolution, has forced the administration into a tense battle of politics with the British garrison, headed by Montgomery, against civilian head of government Louis Mountbatten. This tension can easily lead to more corruption and civil unrest, as if the French occupation zone ever needed more of that."

Today, the Ministry is known to be brutally effective with little corruption, but also is the main symbol of British oppression in Europe."

 FRA_Normandy_Garrison_desc:0 "The British Garrison in Normandy, also known as the British Normandy Police, is a military division stationed in the region of Normandy around Caen and has the job to ensure stability and British loyalty in the French occupation zone. The garrison has not only become a hated institute for the French resistance, but also for the Paris administration made up of British and French civil workers. This tension has made the garrison not only military, but also gave it a political dimension, which commander Bernard Montgomery, lacking any diplomatic tact, is not used to deal with."

According to reports from locals who are opposed to the group, Brossolette and his allies have fashioned together a guillotine, displaying it in the centre of town. Those that were captured were executed with it, and they threaten that they will do the same to any other 'Rosbifs and their cronies who would defile France and their workers.'\n\nLocal military forces have already been alerted, and hope to deal with this small uprising before it can spread any farther."

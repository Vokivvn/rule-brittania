Despite being an integral part of the Austrian Empire, the majority of its population speaks Italian with only a minority speaking either German or Ladin (a romance language similar to the Romansh language of Switzerland). This has caused unrest from the Italian-speaking population of Trient, as well as causing Italian irredentists to claim Trient as a part of a united Italy.\n\n§YEver since 1027, the region has been almost entirely controlled and governed by the Prince-Bishopric of Trient.§!"

#DECISIONS#
estates_austria:0 "The Estates of the Empire"
estates_austria_desc:0 "Despite serfdom being very much a relic of the past, Austrian society is still incredibly stratisfied. While legal equality is enshrined in the laws, everyone in the Empire knows their lane, and certain sociopolitical groups continue to wield massive amounts of influence in various regions of the Empire. Much of this power is wielded through the Herrenhaus, the upper house of the Reichsrat. In order for the gears of Empire to move, their consent must be secured.\n\nThe Burghers (or citizens) represents the urban population of the Austrian Empire, citizens in towns or cities. Typically they represent the small middle and entrepreneurial class in Austria. They are granted a special charter of rights and privileges for themselves and the cities that they represent. Typically many of their members are supportive of national liberalism, such as the national-liberal Verfassungspartei in Austria.\n\nThe Burghers are [AUS.GetAUS_burghers_loyalty]\nThe Burgher’s influence is [AUS.GetAUS_burghers_influence]\nThe Burghers have sway on [?AUS.AUS_burghers_number]% of the country.\n\nThe Aristocracy (or nobility) represents the small ennobled group of the wealthy in the Austrian Empire, typically those with a large amount of privilege. A combination of the old aristocracy and new aristocracy, the nobility of the Austrian empire is diverse and ranges in both ethnicity and religion. While aristocrats are typically apolitical and hostile to party politics, they continue to wield massive amounts of influence through the Herrenhaus as hereditary peer. They will remain supportive of the status quo, as long as their privileges and titles are protected.\n\nThe Aristocracy are [AUS.GetAUS_nobility_loyalty]\nThe Aristocracy’s influence is [AUS.GetAUS_burghers_influence]\nThe Aristocracy have sway on [?AUS.AUS_nobility_number]% of the country.\n\nThe clergy represent a small group that, despite having grown in power over the last few hundred years, continue to remain incredibly important within Imperial politics. The clergy continues to be the base of political Catholicism as a movement, an influential right-wing movement that has informed conservative group such as the Christlichsoziale Partei. While the days of Catholic priests in Austria physically controlling large amounts of land in regions such as Trient or Salzburg are over, their importance has not faltered.\n\nThe Clergy are [AUS.GetAUS_nobility_loyalty]\nThe Clergy’s influence is [AUS.GetAUS_burghers_influence]\nThe Clergy have sway on [?AUS.AUS_clergy_number]% of the country.\n\nFinally, the largest social group in Austria are smallholders, or “free farmers”. They are peasants that own small family farms, usually for subsistence farming. Despite making up such a large percentage of Austria’s population, the smallholders are far from a unified group with unified needs. The only thing that they could ever ask from the Empire is security. If needed, their inexpensive land could even be brought by the Empire and sold to another group altogether.[AUS.AUS_empress_governates]"

AUS_empress_governates:0 "\n\nWith the Empress set on her goal on destroying older imperial institutions in favor of a more modern, secular, and equal Empire, it is clear that the traditional estates are a clear obstacle. Sprawling church lands must be secularized, massive plots of lands owned by the nobility must be reduced to the walls of their villas, and the guilds that hold monopolies over cities must be forced back into their guildhall in favor of popular mayors. The Empress can begin to eliminate these estates and organize them into Federal States, the basis of her proposed system of governments.\n\n% of states within Austria have been turned into Federal States."

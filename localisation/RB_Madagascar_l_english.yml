 POLITICS_STAFFORD_CRIPPS_DESC:0 "If you asked any Conservative or Liberal Member of Parliament about the fate of Richard Stafford Cripps, they would sweat viciously and explain hastily that he has a magnificent job in governing the great colony of Madagascar. After all, one has to of great standing in order to reach such a job, and Cripps was doing fabulous work managing the colony. This is to of course cover the obvious truth. No one in government considers Madagascar great, and Cripps was sent there to protect from a radical shift in colonial governing worldwide.\n\nCripps was a socialist firebrand in government, demanding more rights for natives, and decreased powers to the king. A proud fabian, he stood for what he believed in aggressively, and believed that the British Empire could collaborate with the leftover strands of Communists worldwide. He became massively popular after stopping a possible Ninth Anglo-Ashanti War by drawing up a successful plan for massive concessions.\n\nThe governor-generalship for Madagascar was left open by the resignation of the previous colonial administrator, and the massive popularity of Cripps caused the government to have immediate fears. So they sent him off with a slap on the back and a bottle of whiskey.\n\nThe reforms Cripps have advocated have been radical, and would be creating shockwaves if they were being done anywhere actually important to the empire as a whole. But Cripps is perfectly happy whiling away the hours... if he doesn’t get too ambitious, that is."

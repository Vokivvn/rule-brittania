 POLITICS_KNUD_KRISTENSEN_DESC:0 "There aren't many from Jutland serving this high in the Danish system, especially if not from the upper echelons of society. Knud Kristensen was born to a farmer in 1880 in Ribe. He got lucky when his father befriended the local priest and the priest loaned the father money to send Knud to go to university in Copenhagen. There he studies law and politics while he got more and more active in the Tory party.\n\nFollowing Charles Tvede's resignation as prime minister in 1924, Kristensen stepped up to the task and has lead the country ever since.As a politician he is humble, respectful, yet bold. He holds immense pride in his country, remembers and honor his modest background and has made bettering the lives of the farmers in Denmark his mission.\n\nThat is at least how he portrays himself and his tenure, in reality not much has been done and while experts are divided on Kristensens personal responsibility, they are united in believing that he could do more."

Now it has become the symbol for an old and complacent elite not interested in anything but their continued tenure at top; throwing lavish parties, only to promise even loftier goals for their next term.\n\nThe economic growth the past decade has lead the electorate to believe the sitting government is responsible for their luck,"

 DEN_growing_economy_i_desc:0 "Under the British Empire, the Danish economy has done rather well for itself. A respectable agricultural economy has been recently invigorated by a new wave of trade and industrialization. Every day, Danish and Norwegian goods utilize Hudson Bay charters to transport goods and materials to His Majesty's vast empire. Economists predict that as long as the shipping lanes remain open, the financial situation will remain comfortable for the foreseeable future and get better.."

The most glaring of these is the disaster of an agreement that the Danes in Amalienborg signed with the Hudson Bay Company in the late 1800s to bail Denmark out of bankrupcy. Creating monopolies over shipping to and from all ports in Norway in return for a guarantee to actually bring goods out to small villages has turnt out to be a hinder for real development, letting villages and cities only grow and expand on the mercy of the Board over in Canada.\n\nThe norwegians arent angry, they are tired, tired of waiting, knowing that things could be better. Hopefully, they will be..."

 DEN_unrest_in_mecklenburg_i:0 "Unrest in Mecklenburg"
 DEN_unrest_in_mecklenburg_i_desc:0 "The Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg was acquired by the Kingdom of Denmark in 1842 via the Leipzig Conference and the subsequent treaties that followed. This territory, however, has become increasingly troublesome throughout the last few decades. Protests against the Danish government went unheard, and slowly turned into riots. It is feared that if action is not taken quickly, organized resistance may coalesce in our southern territories.\n\nIf this wasn’t bad enough, the German states to our South quietly sponsor Nationalist movements in the hopes that Mecklenburg may soon fall under their own realms. It seems as if the region is dangling on a fishhook, waiting for any powerhungry  man to step up to the task to lead the charge."


 den.1.t:0 "Our History"
 den.1.desc:0 "The lovely land has laid between the three seas since dawn of time. The Kattegat to the west is the way into the vast foreign world, and our master the United Kingdoms. To the north, Skagerak leading the way to the large wild land of Norway and to the east the Baltic Sea. Where we once ruled. Our history began when the brave Danes fended off Frankish kings from the south and built up an administration unknown in its time, to this part of the world.Our Kingdom grew strong and Fate would have it so that both Norway and Sweden would fall under Danish rule, but the Swedes were not ready for such culture and left hastely.\n\nThis laid the foundation for a longstanding conflic and throughout the 17th and 18th century a series of wars, culiminating in the Great Northern War, hurt our royal family, the Oldenburgs, too much. Crown prince after crown prince died on the battlefields. Suddenly, there were no more males, and the crown climbed the family tree to the closest male, an old relative of the king of Britain. The title quickly reverted to the King, as the relative was old and childless.\n\nA new era in our history had just begun. The beginnning of the 19th century was a golden age for Denmark, with art, literature and science blooming in the grand capital.\n\nIt truly is a lovely land!"

 den.2.t:0 "The State of Denmark"
 den.2.desc:0 "The Union with Britain brought about several changes to our lovely land. The King's absolute power was abolished and in its place, a two chamber parliament. Together known as the Folketing [The People's Hall] where seats are filled by elections in one man sectors. This has evolved into a two party system, much like Britain. Two parties reign supreme: the Union party, the Danish counterpart of the Tories, focused on tradition, stability and preserving the holy union between Britain and Denmark. On the other side of the aisle, the Liberal party, pushing for change, making reforms to make lives better and give more power to the people.\n\nNorway followed togeher with Denmark, when the King of Britain inherited the Kingdom of Denmark. However, legal complications and old documents lead to the Skagen treaty of 1806, where the status of Norway was clarified, a kingdom under union of Denmark, meaning that the British King is king of Norway only in virtue of being king of Denmark. It is thus the King of Denmark's task to find and nominate a governor general for Norway.\n\nThe Norwegian Parliament was established in the same treaty, but chose to leave the British electoral system in favor of a proportional system, but two parties have remarked them selves as the leading competitors, the Norwegian Liberal Party and the Grand Party, established by the first British King's first governor-general in Norway. The Liberal party is currently leading a shaky coalition with the small but loud Labour Party, the Labour harness no respect and has in all fairness lead the government to not be able to accomplish much. In the 1860s Germany collapsed in on itself."

It is an empire, an empire to rival the others, Sweden, Austria and Portugal! The newest aquisition is the Duchy of Mecklenburg, down in Germany. A fertile marsh filled with diligent Germans serving their new king.\n\nSome would say Norway got the short end of the stick, port cities such as Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim and Narvik have become all but chartered ports for the grand Hudson Bay Company, employing more than 20 000 men across the country, it is the largest employer in all of Norway. Its main business is shipping, but over the past 40 years, they have slowly driven small independent fishers into their grasp, profiteering on the entire chain from fresh caught fish all the way till selling the fish on a market.\n\nMecklenburg and the German territories are not satisfied, they have no legal right to German in official correspondence, no right to vote to the Folketing nor the right to office in Copenhagen. Many are still loyal to the old king of Prussia, Wilhelm II, but the peasants are getting restless and demand more and more for each day passing."

The After-New Years Ball is the always an attractive invitation, an excellent chance to meet far away relatives, a chance to meet the King of all the seas George V, as he always takes the trip to Copenhagen. Among other guests that has come all the way are:\n\nEmperor Rudolf of Austria, King Berthold of Sweden, Prince Nikolaus from the Netherlands, King Alexander of Burgundy, and, for many the most exotic guest, Tsar Alexei II, Emperor of all Russia. He does not often travel outside of Russia, but for Amalienborg, he always make sure to keep the date reserved.\n\nSpending for the Ball increases every year, and some have started to question why these absurd sums should not go to the people, they are of course very wrong."

 den.5.t:0 "Governor General dies"
 den.5.desc:0 "Today is a day for mourning, Norway's long serving governor general Jacob Roll Knagenhjelm passed away this morning. His tenure, stretching all the way back to 1915, has seen the decline of industry in Kristiania and the rise of the Liberal Party. Norway is in many ways the same society as it was when he took over as governor, but time is ripe for change.\n\nPrime Minister Knud Kristensen was given the news together with a list of suggested names to recommend the governor general of Denmark to appoint. Kristensen does face a choice however, elections are coming up in September. Many would regard it as unwise to force this decision now, it could be seen as an overstep, because it can be argued that the appointment should be delayed until after the election, so a potential new prime minister could put his hand on Denmark-Norway.\n\nOn the other hand, Norway do need a governor general, and we cannot be sure that the Norwegians will buy our arguments that delaying it is for the better, they could see it as way to increase Copenhagen's power over Norway.\nWho knows?"

 den.6.t:0 "Choosing a New Governor"
 den.6.desc:0 "Not particularly interested in Norway, Prime Minister Kristensen had to have his ministers make a list of suitable candidates to take over the recently vacant position of Governor of Norway. On the list, two individuals stuck out, long time second in command on the Governors court, Peder Anker Wedel-Jarlsberg. He first came into service for the Crown back in 1905 and after spending his entire adult life serving his duty in the Royal administration he knows the ins and outs of courtly affairs. Widely seen as a non-partisan in party politics he should be able to serve as a candidate that could content both sides in parliament.\n\nThe other name standing out, Harald Gram, formerly leader of the conservatives but for the past 8 years he has climbed rapidly in the ministry for Norwegian affairs in Copenhagen, proving his loyalty and dedication to the Union. He would be a solid choice to stand against the liberal movement for more autonomy."

He reports that they were happy with the pick and they could not have chosen a better man themselves. He is pleased to be able to say that the governor's mansion on Bygdøy is cleaned down and some new furniture acquired.\n\nThis went much better than many in Kristensen's government feared and it seems like the risk to nominate a new candidate now has payed off. Good thing to have a governor again, so we can have more control and make sure that everything goes smooth and without any problems."

This morning he brought the party leaders and told them he would resign immediately, and ordered an election to choose the new leader.\n\nPersonally he would prefer if his protege already prominent member of parliament Erik Scavenius should take over.\n\nVilhelm Buhl made a thundering speech even convincing a few whigs to support him."

Norway needs a Governor more than ever, as supplies from England are slowing down and villages along the coast are hurting from it. We stand with three fair choices: we could let the Norwegian parliament choose their favored candidate; we could choose unionst Harald Gram; the last option seem a bit out there, but some have mentioned sending the list to England to have the King there choose for us, to let them know we are still standing with them."

Our trusted sister nation, Denmark-Norway, however, has chosen in this time of distress, to consult with us in a moment of need. It will be our great honor to nominate a person to serve as Governor-General from the Crown of Denmark to the Crown of Norway. This has never happend before, as per the treaty detailing royal obligations and rights, and opposite, it is made very clear that it is the Danish Governorate that has the responsibility to appoint a Governor for Norway. This has usually been interpreted as meaning they must nominate and them alone suggest persons for the task, but for whatever reason, they have asked us to supply them names. The options are as following:\n\nLong time second in command on the Governors court, Peder Anker Wedel-Jarlsberg. He first came into service for the Crown back in 1905 and after spending his entire adult life serving his duty in the Royal administration he knows the ins and outs of courtly affairs.

 den.14.desc:0 "'It is long between days of daylight, as the waves and clouds strangle the brave rays of sunlight that dare reach this long forgotten land, old Norway'\n\nAfter a long travel around Europe, acclaimed and critizised author Knut Hamsum is back to Norway, and with him: a finished manusscript. From people in the know, the new work is rooted in old tradionalistic views about Norway, and deeply suspicious of the English dominance, characterizing the United Kingdom as a 'Dominion of Evil'. The story is about a young man, Håkon Bramsvik, living in a remote village in Northern Norway, longing for his childhood love, Marie Berg-Pedersen, while she studies in London. When the novel starts it has been many years since she left, but one day Marie comes back, but she is now a married woman, and working at the Danish consulate in London. The once loving and caring girl has been corrupted by her years abroad, turnt her cold and cynical. In an un-Hamsunian move, Bramsvik commits suicide in despair, but leaves his farm to Marie.\n\nThe symbols are unusually vivid, according to many so obvious they lose their nuance and sincerity. The significant anti-british sentiment is not necessarily to our benefit, as we wish to keep the stability we still have here north. Any censor of an author with this caliber is out of the question, but having ministers disawow the work could do well."

When confronted with his crime, he stood tall and shouted calls in German about Danish tyranny. There is no such tyranny, so the man was quickly charged with spreading false information and disloyalty to the crown, awaiting his trial.\n\nGetting our hands on important rebellious leaders like Hildebrandt is an important step in our efforts to combat resistance in Mecklenburg."

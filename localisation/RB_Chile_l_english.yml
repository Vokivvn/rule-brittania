 #Leader Descs
 
 POLITICS_PEDRO_DARTNELL_DESC:0 "His Excellency the Grand Captain Pedro Pablo Dartnell Encina is the quintessence of the proud Chilean military: pragmatic, determined, honorable and most of all, loyal to the greater mission of the Chilean Army as a cornerstone of British rule in the Latin American continent. Born in Linares on the 24th of December 1873 to a family descendant of Irish Immigrants, the future Grand Captain studied at the Army Officers’ School before joining the Army. He climbed the ranks, serving as a Lieutenant Colonel in the staff of multiple Grand Captains over the years between his graduation in 1903 and his ascent to the position of General of the Army in 1930. Never one to openly take sides in politics, Ibáñez has done his best to remain apolitical and endorse any and all policies he believed beneficial to Chili.\n\nThis behavior carried on when, in 1930, he was sworn in as the Grand Captain of Chili. Maintaining Chili’s role as a military-first “ultraloyalist” member of the Commonwealth of Earth and the British Empire, H.E. Carlos Ibáñez del Campo quickly became one of the most decorated non-British servants of His Majesty the King.\n\nHis ability to balance the concerns of almost all groups in Chili have earned him plenty of affection, but also a fair share of enemies. In the palaces of government the more radical wings of Chilian politics all share a profound dissatisfaction with his rule. Even in the military, where he makes his only truly radical stand, dissenters work against his goal of enshrining the dominance of the ground forces in Chili’s proud military."

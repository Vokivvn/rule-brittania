 ssd.1.t:0 "People Of Siberia Demand Political Independence"
 ssd.1.desc:0 "As we all know, Ovey's strategy of striking a compromise every single time Ruskies demanded something did not work, and our precious Industrial Jewel was engulfed in a bloodbath, in which our troops fought untill the end, but still lost to natives. However, the evils of Anti-Atlanticism and Russian Ultranationalism were defeated too. The victorious side is a loosely-tied alliance of native oligarchs, cartels and democratic forces, who were paid by the oligarchs to kickstart the bloodbath in the first place. What we have now is one of our most productive factory complexes being under siege by Ruskie hordes and facing risk of total loss. Loss of 10% of planet's land mass is not that terrible considering that 90% of lost land mass is frozen wastes, but just letting go would start an even more horrible precedent and hurt our prestige like no war ever could.\n\nHowever, Ruskies want to resolve the conflict peacefully. They have proposed a so-called "The Great Petition", in which they expressed their desire for full political freedom. Thankfully, that full political freedom will come with some invaluable benefits for us. Our factories will still be under Empire's grip, and the people oF Siberia express desire for cooperation both economically and militarily. They also want to still be in the Commonwealth of Earth, but on special terms, such as special trade agreements and full political independence from the Empire.\n\nIf this petition is rejected, they say that they will "hold their lands until there will be no Siberians to enslave" and such rejection could be treated as a declaration of war. We could destroy these people like they're a bunch of annoying flies, but the collateral damage can be too high and the climate of Siberia can quickly make a seemingly easy operation look like another Anglo-Mexican War. What shall we do?"

The only soil that is right now protected by Siberian administration is the land near Novosibirsk, with it's garrison being under siege from all sides. However, if help will not arrive from the British Empire immediately, they might lose the capital of Siberia too, and the Empire will lose around 10% of Earth's land mass under their control plus a big part of the Russian industrial sector."

 YUSUPOV_DESC:0 "Felix Yusupov is a type of Russian philanthropist that is so common yet so rare among Russian oligarchs. Despite having large amounts of real estate and industrial units, Yusupov decided to go further, and repeated Anika Stroganov's steps by risking his entire wealth and moving his financial resources in Siberia. Like Stroganov, Yusupov's gamble paid off, and he quickly became one of the wealthiest men of Siberia. With his Sibsoyuz and Sibcartel encompassing about 30% of Siberian wealth, he got the profits he couldn't even think about.\n\nBut there was no "fine" in Siberia Yusupov used to know. There were no fine theaters, no fine arts, no fine cinema: only copies of Anglo art sent to colonies in order to make an administrator remind at least something about his home in London.\n\nHowever, there was something "fine" about Siberia's most valuable resource — it's people. Yusupov saw in Siberyaks the things he didn't even remotely see in Central Russia or England: self-sacrifice, courage, diligence and most of all — love of freedom, a personality trait that was discarded by almost everyone, except the Far East and some regions of America. He couldn't collect art like he did in Siberia, but he did "collect" good people, refine them and make them not worry about their finances for the rest of their life. They ranged from high officials to miners and even prisoners: Yusupov didn't care about their positions. \n\nEventually, the oligarch saw that the highest form of "refinement" for Siberian people would be an achievement of independence, in one way or another. He tried to work with Ovey on that case and even achieved some concessions, but Hayden's firm grip ruined all chances to resolve it peacefully. Now, Yusupov leads the Siberian people to liberty through open rebellion, and he knows that even if his attempt fails, the spirit of Free Siberia will never die."
 SPIRID_DESC:0 "By the time she steps into the leader position, Maria Spiridonova has spent more life in prisons of Siberia than on free soil. Evading death penalty for killing one of the Black Hundred's high officials in 1906, Spiridonova instead engaged in a process that was common in Russo-Anglo relations. She was sold to Siberian Trading Company to work as prisoner for life in penal colonies of the Eastern Frontier. For many people it would mark the end of their lives, as mortality rates are even higher than in Mexican labor camps, injustice among jailers is common, and most numbers are omitted by local officials in order to appear soft to Ovey's administration and the High Commission.\n\nMaria, however, never gave up. Using her old friends from what was Russian Social Democraric Revolutionary Party, she used all the things she learned from her activity in Central Russia. With using provocative actions, organizing prisoner strikes and even openly denouncing Anglo rule, she started steadily moving herself and her people from horrifying conditions of Siberian penal colonies.\n\nWith struggle, however, came even more harsh punishments. She was sent to more and more terrifying camps, with her limbs sometimes being intentionally broken by Anglos in order to break her will to fight, too.\n\nBut one day, after 20 years of jail, one letter, which was describing the horrible conditions , was finally delivered to Ovey's administration. Considering the possibilities of another rebellion, which would be apolitical, all-Siberian and would possibly crash the entire Siberian industrial base, Ovey caved in and reorganized the penal system in order to make it transparent and pacify the possible rebels. Spiridonova was not released from the prison, though her conditions were improved significantly.\n\nYeniseisk's penal colony was demolished around half a year ago, and Spiridonova saw the free people for the first time in 30 years. Her mind still remains in jail, but now her only overseer is her conscience."

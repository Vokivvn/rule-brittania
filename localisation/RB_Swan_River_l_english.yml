 ##LEADER BIOS##
 POLITICS_JAMES_MITCHELL_DESC:0 "Sir James Mitchell, governor of the Swan River Colony, was born in Port Leschenault, Australia, and this is something that he wants everybody to know. This is because Mitchell is the first governor of the colony to be born on the continent, with all the governors before him originating from the British Isles. Another thing that Mitchell stresses is his background as a farmer, often failing to mention his time working at the Western Australian Bank. It was from these “humble beginnings” that he was made honorary minister for agricultural expansion, amd eventually rose to become the governor for the entire colony.\n\nAn outspoken anti-federalist, Mitchell was the leading voice behind Swan River’s maintained independence, and was subsequently the man blamed when the disaster regarding Auralia occured. Now, his position is at a crossroads. His party wishes for him to continue his plan of staunch independence, while the liberals and a large majority of the populous wish to enter the Commonwealth to placate their economic situation.\n\nThis is an important choice that Mitchell needs to make. That is, of course, if he can hold his position that long."

 ##IDEAS##
 SWN_Anti_Federation_Government:0 "Anti-Federation Government"
 SWN_Anti_Federation_Government_desc:0 "As the colonies of the East chattered and planned about their “great new federation”, the seat of Swan River’s government in Borloo remained relatively quiet. Few politicians and legal officials were sent to the constitutional convention, mainly due to the staunchly anti-federation viewpoints of the conservative Swan River Executive Council. In the eyes of most governors, the colony was doing fine, and these attempts at unification would do nothing but interrupt the economic development of the relatively young territory.\n\nThis was until the secession of Auralia. The incident left the politicians of the colony scrambling, and with the popularity of the conservative party plummeting ever since, it’s unlikely that they will survive the next election."
 SWN_Auralian_Secession:0 "The Auralian Seccession"
 SWN_Auralian_Secession_desc:0 "Almost overnight, nearly a third of Swan River’s territory and the vast majority of its gold fields, were enveloped into the Commonwealth of Australia. The signs should have been clear as day for the governors, too. The region in the Southeast of Swan River gained a large influx of Australian miners from Batmania, Port Phillip, and New Wales. These migrants had made their voices heard, and their demands were clearly stated: “Join the Commonwealth, or we’ll do it ourselves.”\n\nUnfortunately for Swan River, Governor James Mitchell did not listen, and on June 14th 1935, with the support of both King George V and the Commonwealth of Australia, Auralia was declared a constituent state within the Commonwealth, and the remnants of Swan River was left to rot."
 SWN_Tiny_Population:0 "Tiny Population"
 SWN_Tiny_Population_desc:0 " To say that the colony is stretched thin would be an understatement. Swan River is the most sparsely populated region on the most sparsely populated continent. To make matters worse, the secession of Auralia left our population much smaller, and our borders much larger. This makes maintaining an army and a developing economy extremely difficult for our government."

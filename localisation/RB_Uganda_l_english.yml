 POLITICS_PHILIP_MITCHELL_DESC:0 "It is not common that a new governor in Africa is this excited for his new job, Sir Philip Mithcell feels like he was born for this job. Having studied political economics and the classics, he went to Tanzania to work in the colonial administration. There he learnt Swahili, and became an important translator. The relatively calm occupation was interrupted when he was called to Ethiopia in the ongoing war against Emperor Haile Selassie. After serving a few years in the crumbling civil administration he was invited to take the governor position in Uganda, after the former one resigned.\n\nHis experiences had taught him several things, in Tanzania: some things about how important it is to have vision, letting all different entities establish juridical zones leads to a mess, and in Ethiopia: well, that brutal oppression is a bad way to get good relations with the local population.\n\nBeing skeptical of Brooke-Popham's increasingly tight rule in kenya, Mitchell has decided to try the radical opposite. Could he manage to make the model colony by going where few had went before him? By striking important deals with the local rulers, he could gain legitimacy and probably increase coffee yields, the one measure his superiors recognize."

 ##Ideas##
 UGA_mitchell_administration:0 "Mitchell’s Administration"
 UGA_mitchell_administration_desc:0 "The new governor brought with him an efficient mode of administration, void of many of Britain's formalities, legalese and other antiquated manners. Having served both in Tanzania and Ethiopia Philip Mitchell knows range of power. Too much in Ethiopia, too little in Tanzania. A just and appropriate ground must be reached, necessarily in cooperation with the rules you rule over.\n\nConfident in his ideals, his vision and his plan, he has promised his colonial officials the world. Getting reknowned as adept administrators, shrewd diplomat and clever economists, when Mitchel's plan succeed, they will get promotions, offers from the highest ranking companies in the world, and in 30 years when they lead Hudson Bay Company; East Africa Company, govern in India; the Commonwealth America; they will stand back and remember the man with the plan, Philip Mitchell, and thank him for what he did for them, and the Empire."
 
 UGA_pearl_of_africa_idea:0 "The Pearl of Africa"
 UGA_pearl_of_africa_idea_desc:0 "Uganda is a stunning land, dense jungles, rich in fertile soil, and right in the middle of the Coffee Belt, a band around the globe with just the right temprature and general humidity conducive to coffee production. Ugandan Coffee is in high demand across the globe, especially in the Middle East, where it is seen as some of the best coffee avaliable. Not only is the coffee good, Uganda is a decent land to live in, little violence, pretty nature and an exotic wildlife. Where Kenya seems to be moving in a shaky direction, with settlers taking more and more land, Uganda is moving the opposite direction, with the few Englishmen in the country centering around neighborhoods in the capital. Life in Uganda is good, and Mitchell has every intention to keep it that way."

 uga.1.t:0 "A Clever Proposal"
 uga.1.desc:0 "Uganda produce coffee, a lot of coffee. Each year the colonies of Africa are gauged on a variety of factors, Uganda is gauged on coffee yield. Coffee yields have been growing at a solid 2% each year, just enough to satisfy London. The past years and governors have been quite unremarkable. This is not to say that Uganda's potential is reached: No, far from it Uganda could produce more, a lot more. Philip was appointed governor of Uganda just before Christmas, but has long experience working in Africa and know Swahili better than any of the former governors.\n\nHe has devised a plan to increase coffee yields with over 20% the next 5 years. How could he do that? By working closer to the king of Buganda, Daudi Cwa I, the largest landowner in the colony. In exchange for being in charge of the improving efforts, Daudi Cwa was promised greater autonomy and greater shares of the profits generated. One could say this is Governor Mithcell's plan, but it is just as much king's.\n\nA tempting prospect, and not a totally foreign one to the king. He knew what to do: halt all ongoing efforts, reverse them where they were recently implemented. Getting yield increases is easier with a lower initial yieald. where the Brits offered a finger, Daudi Cwa was gonna take the arm."

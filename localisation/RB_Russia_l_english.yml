 RUS_RULEBRITANNIA_DESC:0 "Once one of Great Britain’s main rivals, Russia suffered humiliation after humiliation in countless conflicts against the Empire, recently leading it to a socialist revolt that threatened the imperial government and the legitimacy of monarchies worldwide. In desperation, the Tsar accepted British assistance in squashing the rebellion, leading to British dominance and utter reliance on behalf of the Russians. Now, the unstable, outdated, and impoverished nation has little satisfaction with the current situation and many demand change, and without some sort of miracle, the great Tsardom will be engulfed in war again."

 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_IV_DESC:0 "Tsar Alexander IV was destined to have the same fate as other European monarchs under British overlordship. Spend your life at feasts, appease the British no matter how filthy you think it is, try to hold yourself while Anglos call you the lesser kind of people, consume foreign literature while trying to think about something else and finish learning English language once and for all. A fate that is not satisfactory, but a fate that is inevitable for most.\n\nAlexander, however, had other plans. Ever since he inherited the throne, he had a roadmap. The roadmap was developed for a decade and a half, with a central point being grand general modernisation of the army. With army modernisations, strength came to the Tsardom, and it has become much more confident on the world stage. With taming the Rukonomika, a steady supply came to the army, and despite some oligarchs investing in Siberia instead to show protest, industrialisation was achieved.\n\nAll of it has a very specific goal. One day Alexander visited Kronstadt, the Swedish-Finnish megapolis and one of the jewels on the Swedish crown. The Tsar knew that there won't be another Kronstadt. There is no point in neither trying to build another city like this nor trying to undermine it's value. There is only one path: capture Kronstadt in any way possible. The Swedes, however, won't give it peacefully.\n\nConsidering the factors, there is only one way Alexander IV will forcefully open the window to Europe for Russia and thus become the greatest Tsar in Russian history: by total war. With the Commonwealth exhausting itself beyond any possible limits, there are only two choices for Russia: either put Kronstadt on the Tsar's crown on perish from history forever."

 RUS.8.t:0 "The Minsk Uprising"
 RUS.8.desc:0 "Dark clouds gather over the skies of Belarus, as the great governorate has succumbed to disaster. Today marks the beginning of a large revolt against the forces of the Russian Army, aimed at overthrowing the authority of Governor Romanov-Reuss and establishing an independent state of Belarus.\n\nIt all started in the city of Minsk, the capital of the territory, where a mysterious group conducting separatist resistance was rumored to be preparing something for days. Nobody knew what it was - a terrorist attack? A grand declaration? A revolt against Russian rule? In the end, it was all of these things. Early in the morning, two raids were reported to have occurred, one in the central government building and one in the local radio station. The Governor was able to escape capture, but he was soon killed as a bomb exploded in his car when he attempted to leave.\n\nOf course, there has been no time to declare a day of mourning and honor Governor Romanov-Reuss, as Minsk is in anarchy. The group behind these machinations, the so-called "Black Cats", have made an announcement, stating that they are prepared to use any means necessary to secure the independence of Belarus from the yoke of the Tsar. For the time being, a rebellion has begun, and it is unlikely to end soon.\n\nMore complex than the recent chaos that has swept Belarus with this rebellion is its leader, Michał Vituška, and his personality. Having lived in the shadows for years, with barely anyone knowing of his existence, he's made himself known almost instantly as the figurehead of the "Black Cats". He has shown his brutality, executing any Imperial officers they have captured, and that he has the means to hurt the Tsardom more than most who try. However, as much as he considers himself a man of the people, Vituška might soon be surprised to know how few actually support him in his efforts."
 RUS.8.a:0 "May the best force win."

 RUS.9.t:0 "Taking Down the Rebels"
 RUS.9.desc:0 "At last, news have arrived from the Belarus Governorate, yet they are not good news. Following a complete disruption in contact with Minsk, the Tsardom had been left in the dark as to what exactly was happening there, and many were worried, especially as the last telegrams to have been sent described a dire situation. Thankfully, the army units we can still communicate with have enlightened the Tsar on the matter.\n\nIt appears that the years of stability and peace in the governorate of the western frontier have ended in a bang, with a separatist group that has named themselves the "Black Cats" seizing control of Minsk and proclaiming Belarus' independence and sovereignty. Our administration there, incapacitated by the most unfortunate death of Governor Romanov-Reuss, has been unable to act quickly, and the rebel alliance might have already gained the upper hand in the region.\n\nDespite this, Tsar Alexander has remained perfectly calm and cool-headed, even if most would not in this situation. In fact, he and the High Command of the Imperial Russian Army seem to be plotting and making new plans.\n\nOur most experienced and respected officers, while they are all in unanimous agreement regarding a decisive action against the Black Cats, believe that this is also an opportunity to test the capabilities of the nation in waging war. They can sense that, sooner or later, the tension between Russia and Sweden will erupt into an all-out conflict. Since rebellions are a normal part of managing an empire, why not use this chance to learn lessons of modern war for when the stakes are truly high?"
 RUS.9.a:0 "We must defeat these Belarusian bandits."

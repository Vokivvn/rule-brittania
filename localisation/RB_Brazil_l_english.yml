 ##leader desc##
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_SEEDS_DESC:0 "Sir William Seeds is a relatively new face to running the British half of the Condominium of Brazil, being appointed to the position after the previous British representative's death. Born in 1882 to an Ulster Protestant family in Dublin, Seeds' early life is of little note, the only thing worth knowing is his aptitude in foreign languages, speaking ones such as Russian and, importantly, Portuguese.\n\nHe then entered service for King and Country in the Foreign office, serving in ambassadorships in other countries (when they were still around). Through this he was noted to be quite competent and his knowledge of multiple languages rather useful.\n\nEventually, he was appointed to His Majesty's Department of Government in Rio De Janeiro in the Condominium, where he distinguished himself due to his knowledge of Portuguese which was sorely lacking in the offices there, allowing them to communicate easier with the locals and most importantly the other half of the Condominium, the Portuguese.\n\nThrough this, he rose up the rungs of the colonial government to be appointed the head of Britain's half of the government, his equivalent for the Portuguese being Bernardino Machado. However, with his newfound position of power some rather eccentric tendencies have come to show, including some rather eccentric ideas..."

##ideas##
bra_king_coffee:0 "King Coffee"
bra_king_coffee_desc:0 "For as long as Brazil has been around, and especially since the British and Portuguese takeover, the coffee crop has dominated the Condominium, with it being the biggest creator of jobs, wealth, and the most valuable export the Condominium has to offer. It is in the best interests to keep this in place for the Condominium to survive, but there are talks in the British ofa  change of crop..."

bra_labour_unrest:0 "Labour Unrest"
bra_labour_unrest_desc:0 "The working conditions in the Condominium are at best abysmal, at worse comparable to slavery. Little to no working regulation has been put in place by the administration, and as such the working population suffer the worst of this. This has led to a growing labour movement demanding more rights in the workplace and better conditions, but for the most part have been ignored by the government."

bra_none_dominant:0 "The Two Partners - None Dominant"
bra_none_dominant_desc:0 "The Condominium, officially, is run as an equal colony by both the British and Portuguese governments. However, on the ground in Brazil the story is rather different. The two bodies usually keep to themselves except for when they must work together, and the idea that they must work together is mostly laughed at in both circles. Both sides see themselves as the rightfully dominant partner of the colony, and as such will attempt to achieve this."

bra_portugal_dominant:0 "The Two Partners - Portuguese Dominant"
bra_portugal_dominant_desc:0 "Following the British part of the government's abysmal and terrible argument for introducing tea as the new cash crop of the country, the Portuguese have achieved dominance over the Condominium. This is much to the relief of the Brazillian population, with the Portuguese speaking the same language and having a common history for the msot part."

bra_anglos_dominant:0 "The Two partners - British Dominant"
bra_anglos_dominant_desc:0 "Following the British part of the administration's convincing and intelligent argument for the introduction of tea as the new cash crop of the colony, they have achieved dominance over the Condominium. They are set to ensure that profits can be maximised in the country, and the introduction of the new tea crop is done rapidly."

bra_anglos_dominant_2:0 "The Two partners - British Dominant"

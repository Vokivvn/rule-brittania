 SIB_complete_selfreliance_desc:0 "Despite the harsh climate, Siberia became one of the luckiest nations of Eastern Europe.

 sib.26.t:0 "At The Top Of The Mountain"
 sib.26.desc:0 "Like every being must have a meaning in their life, every man must believe in something that can back them, help them, or make them go through the most harsh conditions and come back alive. The miners of Ural are especially prone to this, since the conditions are even more harsh, the pay is never enough and you have to wake up every day and realize that all of your work is going not to you, but to some unknown people in England.\nMost of them find comfort by believing in so-called Mistress of the Copper Mountain, a legendary creature which is believed to be the spirit of Ural Mountain. Many people describe it differently, but the most likely image in the head of a simple miner will be either an invisible spirit or a beautiful woman in malachite dress, with green eyes, a pretty braid and a magnificent voice which would subdue everyone who would come to her "realm". Other (mostly British) tales describe her as a an abdominable, ghoulish creature with lizard body with human head, but these stories are largely discarded by locals.\n\nThe Mistress is believed to be a keeper of high mastery, hiding the secrets and riches of the Uralsfrom "foreign eyes", favouring only brave and freedom-loving workers by showing them the location of natural treasures. The "foreign eyes" are mostly assumed to be Boyar henchmen, Tsarist officials, and - now - Anglo administrators. It is largely assumed that the Mistress represents the man's desire for freedom, respect for the common worker and disdain for high officials.\n\nHowever, things are starting to change. The workers of Ural are now receiving enough money to pay not only for themselves, but for their families and their other relatives too. With some economic and politic workarounds, we have achieved peace that was wanted by all. With no oppression towards the natives of Siberia, there have been no major uprisings in the last 30 years — an unbelievable record for Russia. No one, from British officials to common workers, cannot understand how united Ural truly is. With no cause to rebel and no motive to resist, belief in the Mistress has been steadily going down in this decade.\n\nWith these astounding results, we can finally sit down for the first time since we came here, relax and realize: we have become the real masters of the Copper Mountain, with no force able to resist coming cultural, technological and societal progress we bring to these lands. We landed our foot on the Last Frontier as craven people, but now we finally have the ability to stand up and raise our flags for the Empire as proud people of Siberia." 
 sib.26.a:0 "To bravery of our people, hurray!"  
 ESMOND_DESC:0 "Esmond Ovey is a prime example of why political dynasties may sometimes work for lower classes. Ovey's grandfather was an administrator of Siberian Trading Company, Ovey's father was a high-ranking official in Novosibirsk, and Esmond himself is now an administratror of not only STC, but also Siberia itself. And sometimes, it's right to just let things running the same way they are. Oveys were always praised as pragmatic and calm people, and under their rule, Siberia always was a quiet place compared to Central Russia or the Far East.\n\nBut sometimes, a man can be too pragmatic. With each time he proposes a compromise to Siberian oligarchs, self-proclaimed "aristocrats" and partisans to resolve the coming conflict peacefully, native resistance grows. With each time he decides to jail an insurgent instead of executing him, natives start demanding more and more. With each time he asks the British Empire for a slight concession, self-determination parties grow stronger, and the worst Evil is closer and closer to breaking out.\n\nSiberian Industrial Zone is growing rapidly, yet one question bothers the high commissioners of England: at what point the man's patience will end?" 
 sib.2.t:0 "The End"

 sib.2.d:0 "Legacy of the Great Petition will not be forgotten!"
 sib.1.t:0 "The New Administrator"
 sib.1.desc:0 "Now with Ovey's death, Siberia has been thrust into a power vacuum. It was assumed that Ovey would rule over Siberia like a man assumes that the day is bright and the night is dark. With his assassination, the position of High Commissioner to Siberia became both empty and even less attractive to British bureaucrats.\n\nThankfully, we've been able to find a man that will take Ovey's place. In a rather surprising turn of events, the only man who wanted to bring justice to Siberia without any salary raise was Arizona's county sheriff and state official, Carl Hayden. His previous position may seem too low for a High Commissioner, but due to our already short budget, his effectiveness as sheriff, and his hard line stance against the type of rebellion that got Ovey killed, he looks much better as a candidate. After all, even an American colonial would be a much better leader than any kind of Russian, so we have no choice in that matter."
 #sib.1.a:0 "An American, huh?"
 sib.3.t:0 "Plans For The Future"
 sib.3.desc:0 "As all good colonies do, we must obey the rules that England sets us. This year is not exceptional to us.\n\nThe High Commission of Britain has ordered us to:\n\n1. Increase the steel export by at least 10%.\n\n2. Decrease Native Wealth Ownership by 25%.\n\n3. Rebuild the burned out factory at Salekhard.\n\n4. Build two additional arms factories in Yekaterinburg.\n\n5. (marked "IMMEDIATELY") Interrogate the major figures of Siberia. If needed — use power to suppress them.\n\nWithout further interruptions, we need to make it out at in range from one to three years."

 sib.5.desc:0 "With tensions brewing more and more, we need to do something with the Powers That Be of Siberia to prevent open conflict and possible breakout of violence. We have four major figures who cause the most trouble in the Frontier, and interrogating them is our first and foremost priority.\nMajor figures, from most important to less valuable:\n\n- Felix Yusupov, local oligarch, leader of Sibsoyuz, one of the largest industrial cartels of Siberia. Possible crimes: abuse of power, tax fraud, support of trade unions in one way or another, support of movements that undermine the Imperial rule in the region, participation in conspiracies.\n\n- Vladimir Gil, fugutive. Crimes: assassination of several prominent officials, participation in crime groups and conspiracies.\n\n- Nikolai Ustryalov, self-proclaimed revolutionary. Crimes: arson, Marxist propaganda, illegal border crossing.\n\n- Nikolai Trubetzkoy, historian and linguist. Crimes: illegal book publishing, insulting the Imperial rule, leading a large illegal organisation.\n\nWith this data, it's time to crack upon the Plot and destroy the rebel scum."
 sib.5.a:0 "Bring us the chairs, please!"
 HAYDEN_DESC:0 "Arizona's county sheriff and official, a man who lived through the entire Second Anglo-Mexican war and kept peace in one of the Great Burning Border regions, became an administrator of one of the most cold and harsh but calm regions in the world because no one else wanted to take the administrator's place.\nIf you would tell that to Esmond Ovey (if he was alive), Felix Yusupov or High Commissioners of Britain, they would laugh in your face and think that you're insane.\nThey don't laugh now."
 sib.6.t:0 "Oligarch's Finest Hour"
 sib.6.desc:0 "The "interrogation" didn't go as good as we'd like it to be at all. Yusupov has decided to cancel it at the last moment, but promised to send one of his men to regulate any concerns about him.\n\nA talk with Ivan Sereda, a man too young to be Yusupov's henchman, didn't tell anything worth of value, too. All the statements he did were either repeating exactly what Yusupov said earlier, outright denying anything any proofs of Yusupov's corruption, or saying that Yusupov's position stays "as usual" without any specifications. It is worth stating that "usual" position of Yusupov was never specified before, plunging us into an even more confusing situation than before.\n\nAfter two hours of fruitless talk, Sereda was set free, and Yusupov's interrogation was postponed after all other interrogations are finished."
 sib.6.a:0 "Why can't Russians just speak clearly?"
 sib.7.t:0 "The World's Best Conversation About Politics"
 sib.7.desc:0 "Sending a Russian to talk with another Russian about important things was a mistake. The Brtiish investigators understood it about half a hour into Trubetzkoy's interrogation.\n\nTo make the quality of talk better, a native Russian speaker was assigned to be an interrogator, with other native Russian speaker being the translator and a British person writing the translated conversation down.\n\nThe conversation's quality started detoriating right after the interrogator received information on who Nikolai Trubetzkoy really is. The interrogator is believed to be an analyst that is so pro-British and so anti-French (despite not seeing a single French person in their life) in their positions it would be considered almost unhealthy, and meeting one of the most influential anti-atlanticists in Russia has started a disastorous chain reaction. Beginning with a simple question "Why do you do this?" to Trubetzkoy and an equally simple answer "Because I hate them." from Nikolai, the conversation quickly devolved into one of the most heated conversations Russian aristocracy can handle.\n\nThe interrogator openly started to throw in the most sharp insults he knew, calling the Duke a "filth entusiast" and "frog-swallowing Catholic in denial", while Russian aristocrat retalliated by calling the interrogator a "self-hating swine defending his owner" and "a creature that baffles Protestantism by just continuing to exist". This "sensible" conversation continued to the point when translator decided to stop translating right after the interrogator promised to replace his carpet with Trubetzkoy's skin and would not hesitate with doing it, while Trubetzkoy promised to hang him first when the "blue tide" comes.\n\nAll four people were escorted out of their room shortly after chair clattering started to be heard, and the files were decided to be put away as none of the conversation made any sense. Both Trubetzkoy and the Interrogator along with their homes were put under guard, and the Duke's next interrogation is postponed until better times would come."   
 sib.7.a:0 "Imagine them having independence..."
 sib.9.t:0 "Wolf's Last Stand"
 sib.9.desc:0 "The interrogation of Vladimir Gil has ended as quickly as it started. Instead of answering questions, the Wolf decided to punch the interrogator in the face, and then proceeded to beat him until he passed out. Then, he used his keys to run out of the cell and find the exit out of the building.\n\nThankfully, the guards responded rather quickly and shot him several times in the legs until he fell to the ground. Gil was thrown in the jail again, and all further attempts interrogate without at least two armed guards were cancelled."

 sib.8.t:0 "A Ticket To Outer Lands"
 sib.8.desc:0 "Compared to other interrogations, they were infinitely more fruitful, useful and interesting than Ustryalov's one.\n\nWhy?\n\nUstryalov simply didn't come to the interrogation.\n\nAfter waiting about ten hours, the disappointed interrogator just walked home.\n\nIt is assumed that Ustryalov simply uses his favourite tactic: commit a crime, run away to the lawless Far East, wait a bit, come to Siberia, repeat. It seems like it'll continue to work until we just put him in jail."

 sib.20.desc:0 "Anglo intelligence services can show wonders when they are pressured to work for once. In Siberia, it's not an exception. With some little more pressure on people who only pushed papers back and forth for their entire life, we finally made a coherent track of all Ustryalov's locations. With data like this, it'll be easy to track him down and finally get rid of one of the most slimy criminals in Siberia once and for all."
 sib.20.a:0 "God Bless Loose Lips!"
 sib.21.t:0 "Ustryalov Calls For A Duel"
 sib.21.desc:0 "In a rather surprising development of situation, Ustryalov has publicly called Carl Hayden to a duel, saying that "that's how we do it in Russia and that's how you do it in Arizona, too". Despite Carl Hayden being almost over 60, he responded positively, saying that "it'll be fun to shoot down criminals personally once again". The duel will commence in three days on Novosibirsk's Central Square, with tickets already being sold and bets being made."

sib.30.t:0 "High Commissioner's Vacation Day"
sib.30.desc:0 "None of us can work all year without any breaks. Not even High Commissioners, who have to travel in different every day in their life, need some rest. The designation for a vacation is not a problem when you have the entire world on your knees, so choosing the land is entirely Commissioneer's choice.\n\nSurprisingly for us, the High Commissioneer choose Siberia. Perhaps either relative tranquility of the region or beautiful nature of the region helped it. Despite not really being ready for such high-class tourists, we tried our best to satisfy the diplomat.\n\nTo make him not regret choosing Siberia over us, we tried our best to make his vacation as unforgettable as possible. Despite us oftering the best hotels and guard in Novosibirsk, the Commissioneer decided to travel around Siberia alone, talking only to Siberian natives in broken Russian. The senior diplomat tried to cross several cities by travelling with Ural-Siberian Railroad, but quickly decided to stop when he saw the magnificent Irtysh. He then spent the rest of his day fishing and hunting any animal that comes near him. Despite not catching any animal in the end, his haul was pretty massive. The diplomat ended up carrying several pikes, carps and eels and had to require help in order to carry them all.\n\nThe High Commissioneer overall enjoyed his trip and said that he will certainly try to come next year."
sib.31.t:0 "Predators Of The Sky"
sib.31.desc:0 "A Siberian bandit's life is tough. There are no roads to cross, no railroads except the main one, and no way to cross the harsh Taiga. The only hope he has is using a plane to quickly travel or deliver an illegal package from one point to another and then attempt to land in a safe place. Finally, he starts a plane full with illegal weaponry and attempts to fly to Krasnoyarsk.\n\nSuddenly, halfway through he hears another engine's roar. He knows exactly what it is. The only good thing is that he doesn't hear shots yet: if he would hear them, he would be already dead. He has two options: try to land in a local airport, be immediately arrested, having his entire wealth seized and his head put on a guillotine, or try to get away but with a 90% chance of getting shot down, engulfing the entire plane in flames and making him die painfully.\n\nFinally, he decides to risk his life and make the most dangerous maneuver he knows. He tries to fly straight down and then try to disorientate the predator, but before he even does that, several shots tear apart his left wing. His plane spins several times before the bandit realizes that there's no way to save his life now.\n\nThe Air Police was set by Ovey's administration about five years ago and specializes on catching illegal air traffic from British Far East, Russia and Siberia. It consists of various former civilian pilots and light fighters of 1920's: just enough to carry justice on the Frontier. Sometimes the Air Police even raises up entire squadrons to catch illegal pilots and the work of our fighters cannot be underappreciated. These pilots stand for justice and decimate rebel power both in the land and in the sky."
